Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Dr. Brett Contreras. Dr. Brett Contreras holds a doctorate degree in sports science and is a certified strength and conditioning specialist. He has over three decades of experience training everyday people, athletes, and coaches on how to get stronger and develop larger muscles these days. Brett is best known as the glute guy for his pioneering of exercises for women and men to strengthen and build their glutes in order to be able to move better, prevent and heal pain and injuries.

And of course, for aesthetic reasons. Today's discussion is a very important one because anyone interested in their immediate and long-term health needs to resistance train. The science is extremely clear on that. However, there are a lot of questions about how best to resistance train today. Brett clarifies how often to resistance train, what movements to do, and how to make continual progress. And in particular, how to build a resistance training program that is tailored to your unique aesthetic and performance goals. For example, we discuss how to prioritize the growth and strengthening of your glutes or arms or shoulders or calves or back basically whichever body part or parts you need to emphasize while not losing progress in other areas and in many cases while still making progress in other areas.

0 (1m 26s):
We also explain how to Gain Muscle while getting leaner, why the speed of your weight movements probably matters less than selecting the proper variety of movements to target all parts of a muscle. And Brett explains exactly which movements you should do in each workout to ensure well-rounded development of the various muscle groups, including of course, the glutes. Dr. Brett Contreras has considered one of the most trusted voices in this entire space, and that's because he's highly credentialed, meaning he knows the science inside out. He also has trained thousands of people and he gets them spectacular results. In fact, the before and afters of his clients are nothing short of extraordinary. So if you currently resistance train or you want to start resistance training, and perhaps you're one of those people who's wary about getting too big or you want to just grow one part of your legs and not another, or just your glutes, but not have larger legs, or maybe if you just want to be bigger overall.

0 (2m 15s):
Today, Dr. Brett Contrera shares the knowledge that anyone novice or experienced can incorporate into their fitness routine to achieve better results faster. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme. Today's episode does include Sponsors. And now for my discussion with Dr. Brett Contreras. Dr. Brett Contreras, welcome

2 (2m 45s):
Dr. Andrew Huberman. It's a, it's a pleasure. Thank you so much for inviting me on.

0 (2m 50s):
The pleasure is mine. I've been following your content for a long time now, and I and many other people are super interested in how they can resistance train best for the purpose of getting stronger. And let's admit it, most people who do some resistance training probably want some Hypertrophy, some muscle growth, perhaps not in their entire body. Some people do, but in specific body parts, they want to grow bigger arms, they want to grow bigger glutes, they wanna grow bigger calves. That seems to be a theme nowadays. Glutes and calves seem to be the new biceps, as they say. So let's start off with the basics.

0 (3m 30s):
Let's take the typical, if there were one. There isn't one, but let's, let's imagine the typical woman or man in their thirties or forties who's never really done any resistance training, maybe done some yoga, some running, maybe did a sport in high school, maybe not, and they are interested in building some muscle to shape their body the way they'd like to shape it. What is the Frequency of workouts that you could give as kind of across the board? What's too many, what's too few per week?

2 (4m 4s):
Yep. So I would say two times a week, full body would be like the minimum. Now you could see results training just one day a week. Imagine if you, you know, and if you tracked your weights and like if you had a coach that was, that knew what they were doing, you could get good, good results. Just lifting weights one day a week, it would be a brutal day, but it would be full body. You'd hit mostly, you know, the big basic multi-joint movements. But if you stuck to that, you would see a lot of gains and you could keep seeing gains for, you know, theoretically an entire year or two. If you wanna maximize your gains, you need to hit a muscle probably twice a week.

2 (4m 45s):
There's some evidence that you, that, you know, maybe three times a week is best, but that's hard to recover from. But I would say for the majority of listeners who are eager to get started, you get so much of your results from the first set, the first set, you do

0 (5m 2s):
The first work set after

2 (5m 4s):
The first working set you do. Yep. And then, you know, adding more volume, adding more Frequency, it's not linear.

0 (5m 11s):
So it sounds like if somebody is relatively new to resistance training, like they're in their first year of resistance training, the lower limit, given that most people don't have a coach and are probably not willing to put in the kind of intensity for an, a whole body workout, to just train once per week seems like twice per week, hitting each body part twice per week. So whole body twice per week. Is that, that's what I'm hearing. How many sets do you recommend per exercise after a sufficient warmup?

2 (5m 39s):
In my online programs, I always recommend three sets. When I train people in real life, it's typically two sets. But I, it's, and, and I would say most of the world does four sets. You know, like most people just generically do four sets per, per exercise. It's just kind of what, and most people do bro splits. They do body part splits. Like what, what the most of the world does isn't always what's best. And I, there's nothing wrong with doing four sets. It's just that people aren't focused. They just kind of go through the motions. You'll say, you know, Hey Andrew, what's your workout? And if you go, well, I do, you know, bench press, I do 1 35 for 15, and then I do 180 5 for 12, and then I do 2 0 5 for eight, and then 2 25 for five.

2 (6m 27s):
Well, that's what you do every week. Then why would you grow? Why would you adapt? Why would you see results from that? So a lot of people just go through the motions when you have a plan and you're u utilizing Progressive Overload. So we can talk about volume, Frequency, all these things. But the main thing is, are you progressively overloading the muscles? Are you putting more tension on the muscles over time? And that's how people grow. So it's like you can, you can geek out on the variables, which I love to do, but if your program is working, then you're getting stronger over time. You don't need four sets to do that. You need to take notes, have a logbook or an app that keeps track of your progress and you have a goal in mind.

2 (7m 10s):
And I don't think most people do that. So it's like, if I have one of my female clients and we're doing a leg press or a Hip Thrust or something and, and say their main goal is to grow their glutes. And my goal for the day is for you to set a pr PR meaning personal record on Hip Thrust. And you know, they've hit, they've done 315 pounds for eight reps. And I say, okay, I want you at least tying eight, but nine or 10 would be good in the beginning. They, you can gain strength. You newbie, we call, talk about newbie gains. You gain strength every time you come in for the first few months. It's the greatest time to be a lifter. It's so funny. In fact, you get spoiled and then it's depressing when the newbie gains end.

2 (7m 53s):
But if they reach the goal, if they say, I have 'em warm up, and then they hit three 15 for nine or 10, that's the, the goal is done. That's what I wanted. And so do you need a second set? Yeah, you can do a second set. You can also, a lot of my colleagues would say, you shouldn't go to failure your first set, 'cause then your second set, you'll be fatigued and you should, you could do four sets where your fourth set is to failure. There's a lot of ways to do things and every coach has their own system. My system that I've had success with is kind of like focused on gaining strength over time so that you don't require so many sets.

2 (8m 35s):
In fact, I would rather, I like my client's training three times per week. Full body, three times per week, full

0 (8m 41s):
Body three times per week

2 (8m 42s):
Or LULUL, lower, upper, lower, upper, lower

0 (8m 46s):
With a rest day in between,

2 (8m 48s):
No, Monday through Friday, lower upper, lower upper take Saturday and Sunday off.

0 (8m 52s):
Wait, step it through. 'cause you're speaking fast, lower upper

2 (8m 56s):
LULUL, lower, upper, lower, upper, lower. Keep in mind, 74% of my followers are women. I'm the glute guy. So people, so my, most of my followers are women. So they women and men have different, they, they can train the same way for their gains. There's a lot of kind of experts coming out now saying, women and men need to train totally differently. They don't need to train differently as per like the, the the variables and stuff. The, the thing is they have different goals. A lot of women want their glutes, they prioritize lower body more than, whereas men want more upper body. So then our exercise selection is gonna differ and our splits are gonna differ if we do, if we do split it up, they want typically three lower body days and two upper body days.

2 (9m 43s):
Whereas men would want probably the opposite th three upper body days and two lower body days, for example. But anyway, this is, there's so many ways to do things that may, I could go on, we could go on and on for an hour about the different ways to do things. But you, you, a lot of many roads can lead to Rome, but you do need to make sure that you're gaining strength over time if you wanna muscle to substantially change, but you can't have that increase, that PR can't come at the expense of decreased range of motion or sloppy form. That's probably the number one tenant of strength training is Progressive Overload. And the listeners need to understand that because other, otherwise you're just gonna be, be spinning your wheels now.

2 (10m 25s):
Now it's not just say you can't make gains not utilizing Progressive Overload. In fact, we talked about this on the, when we were working out yesterday, how to use the mind muscle connection. But ultimately, how do you know you're placing increasing demands on the muscle over time? Your barometers should be like, you know, the loads and, and the, the sets and reps that you're doing

Aurora (10m 45s):
Perhaps one of the most underestimated but powerful tools to improve your mental health, your physical performance and your cognitive performance is ensuring you get enough hydration every day. The unfortunate reality however, is that tap water often contains contaminants that negatively impact our health. So while we're trying to get great hydration, that can cause serious problems. In fact, a 2020 study by the environmental working group estimated that more than 200 million Americans are exposed to PFAS chemicals, also known as forever chemicals through drinking tap water. These forever chemicals are linked to serious health issues such as hormone disruption, gut microbiome disruption, fertility issues, and many other health problems, some of which are just now coming to light. For all these reasons, I was thrilled when I came across Aurora water filters and now they're a Sponsor of this podcast. Aurora makes what I believe are the best water filters on the market. I've been using the Aurora countertop system for almost a year now. Aurora's filtration technology removes harmful substances, including endocrine disruptors and disinfection byproducts, while preserving beneficial minerals like magnesium and calcium. It requires no installation or plumbing, so it's extremely convenient. It's built for medical grade stainless steel and it fits beautifully on your countertop. It's something that you would want to have in your kitchen. What's additionally impressive to me is Aurora's transparency. You can find all of their independent third party test results right on their website and they report reduction data over the full life of the filter. If you'd like to try Aurora, you can go to aurora.com/huberman and get an exclusive discount. Again, that's aurora rora rra.com/huberman.

Carbon (12m 14s):
Today's episode is also brought to us by Carbon. Carbon is a diet coaching app built by a nutrition expert, Dr. Lane Norton. Now I've used Carbon for more than three years now, and I have to say it's among the most powerful tools for nutrition coaching and effective weight management that I've ever encountered. Especially if your goal is like mine, which is to maintain or build muscle while also losing fat. Now I'm turning 50 years old this September and even though I consider myself in pretty good shape and I've been training for a long time and trying to eat right, one of my goals is to hit 50 in the absolute best shape of my life. To do that, I'm dialing in my nutrition using carbon with the goals of increasing my muscle mass, increasing my strength, while also decreasing my body fat. I've been raving about the Carbon app to friends and to family and to members of my Huberman Lab team over the last few years. And everyone who's joined me in using it has found it to be tremendously useful. In fact, some of those people are going to join me in my approaching 50 fitness goals and body composition goals. My birthday is September 26th, and so I'd like to invite you to join if you would like to improve your body composition and fitness to also use the carbon app. Now there are a lot of apps out there that are focused on fitness and nutrition, but what makes carbon different is that it doesn't just hand you a one size fits all plan. It actually learns your metabolism over time and it adapts your program based on your results. It also allows you total flexibility in how you eat. So if you're looking to take a smarter, more personalized approach to your nutrition, I can't recommend the Carbon app enough to try carbon, you can go to join carbon.com/huberman. While carbon does not typically offer trials or promotions, they've agreed to give a free seven day trial to all huberman podcast listeners. Again, that's join carbon.com/huberman to get a seven day free trial.

0 (13m 58s):
Let's just, if you don't mind, I'll just want to take a slight step back and highlight a couple things that you said and, and maybe clarify a few of them for myself and, and for the listeners, the goal of going into the gym to train is foremost to create a stimulus that you need to adapt to so that the muscle grows and gets stronger. In theory one could do that by training the entire body once per week, but that would be a very taxing workout. Probably requires a coach to do properly and in general, most people are probably gonna benefit from training two or three times per week minimum.

0 (14m 39s):
Okay. It does seem to be the case lately that most of the papers, as I understand, point to every muscle should be trained twice per week, perhaps not as intensely in the two work workouts, but at least twice per week. And you said three times per week is probably even more beneficial. I like this lower upper, lower upper, lower low, low, low five days per week format that you listed out. When I see that, I think, okay, lower body three times per week. Wow. Right now I train my legs once per week intensely. So that's calves, tibs, hamstrings, quads, I now, because of your tutorial train adductors, the inner thighs and glutes all in the one workout.

0 (15m 28s):
And then four or five days later I do a sprint workout, which is my second leg workout. It's not an in gym workout, it's a sprinting workout, training legs three times per week in the gym with weights and machines, et cetera. Sounds like a lot. So my question is, for the three or even the two lower body workouts that men or women are doing, are they doing the same exercises in every one of those lower body workouts for the same muscle groups or, and in addition to that, are they hitting quads three times a week or twice a week directly because many people can't recover, or at least the soreness doesn't go away in between workouts.

0 (16m 9s):
So how are you splitting up lower body if somebody is training lower body two or three times per week?

2 (16m 17s):
Great question. So first of all, I wanna mention before steroids became a thing, the bodybuilders back then, if you can look up like Steve Reeves, reg Park, John Grek, they did three full bo I think they all did three full body workouts a week. Or they trained mostly full body, but they'd hit muscles frequently. The thing is they didn't do, now we have so many machines we have, so they did, they did mostly Barbell training and you know what I mean, they focused on the big basics and they would repeat movements. So, so

0 (16m 47s):
Squatting three times a week. Yeah. Deadlifting three times per week.

2 (16m 50s):
Yeah. The goal is gaining strength. So with every person, it's unique and there's so many ways to do this. If I have some people deadlift hard twice a week, they might get back pain. Even if they're using good form, what if they're really weak, have really weak hamstrings in isolation and I start giving them seated leg curls and it transfers to their deadlift. The seated leg curls doesn't put stress on their low back. You get stronger by identifying weak links and there's a lot of transfer between the different Lifts. So I don't believe you need to repeat the same movements all the time.

2 (17m 30s):
And I also think you should switch it up every month. And that's one thing I've had a lot of success with with my system. I've had a lot of success. We have like a, a squat and bench press month, then the next month will be a deadlift in chin up month.

0 (17m 47s):
What does that mean? That means that during all lower body work workouts you're doing squats and dead Lifts.

2 (17m 52s):
No, you do always do all the movement patterns. It's what you do first and what you focus on. That's what you're going for the PR on. But I'm not trying to have you get stronger at squats every single month. And if you don't like Barbell squats, you can do, you know,

0 (18m 7s):
Hack squat,

2 (18m 8s):
Hack squat, leg press. It could be a single leg movement, but it's the movement pattern from the side view. Does it look like a squat? So that could be a squat. Hack squat, lunge belt squat, leg press, V squat, step up, Bulgarian split squat. A lot of different, it's a

0 (18m 23s):
Buffet. People can pick what works

2 (18m 25s):
From the side view. Does it look like a squat on one or two legs? It's, they all work very similarly. So I want you getting stronger at those. But not every month because the next month I might switch to like deadlift and, and, but they all have different rules. So here's what I kind of realized. Have you ever focused on, you, you say you don't want your, your chest and back, you're not trying to grow maximally, but if you, let's say you're just trying to get as big as humanly possible. Have you ever said, I wanna see if I can work my way up to 20 chin ups?

0 (18m 57s):
I haven't but you mean in a single set? Yeah, no, I've, I have not done that.

2 (19m 1s):
Well, if you did do that, your back muscles would probably get bigger, right? Sure. But you'd, you'd be like, okay, I have this chin up goal, I wanna get 20 chin up. How am I gonna get there best I'm gonna start doing more chin up. Maybe you don't like chin up all the time. So you do heavy supinated pull downs. I've realized they transfer, there's like a one on one to one correlation. I never realized that till the last couple years. Supinated treating it like a chin

0 (19m 27s):
Up. Okay, so for those that don't know, supinated means palms facing you, palms facing you basically palms facing, you pull down or on a pull down machine Yeah. To, you know, chest level or something in that to the front. Obviously you

2 (19m 39s):
Can recover quickly from those. So you could do chin ups or pull downs three times a week. But what's going to, what else will help your chin ups training more biceps. When I have my female clients start doing Barbell curls and easy bar curls, their chin ups went up. So it has its own rules. When you focus on like the chin up month, you can hit these movements frequently, you can recover from them. But what about deadlifts? If I said you're gonna focus on deadlifts this month, I don't know many lifters that can deadlift really hard twice a week they beat you up. Especially when you get strong. So you might have, you might, if you're hitting three full body workouts a week, maybe you only do heavy deadlifts once a week, but the other time you're doing a more like a hinge, like a stiff leg deadlift or a good morning real strict, not going crazy.

2 (20m 27s):
You might leave some reps in reserve or you're just really strict so you don't get, so you don't get as sore from that. And then the other day might be a ham, you start out with a hamstring movement or something. These Lifts have different rules that you figure out over time. And it also depends on the individual. Some people can squat three times a week, some people can, can't get away with that. They'll develop hip pain, knee pain, low back pain. So there's kind of this art of how to design programs that allow the masses to, to, to build strength. But whenever you work with someone individually, you have to, you stray from it a little bit. But anyway, I do believe hitting a muscle three times a week is a little bit better. But it's, it's more risky.

2 (21m 7s):
It's, you can over, you can spin your wheels. I don't wanna say overtrain 'cause over-training syndrome is something, but what we all know what it means. It means stagnating because you're not properly recovered, you're spinning your wheels, you're not, and it's really hard to recover from three times a week. So that's why the safest bet is hit a muscle twice a week. But I think if you know what you're doing, you can do three times a week.

0 (21m 31s):
My understanding and my experience is that if you do a proper warmup and then you train close to failure or to failure for one or two sets, maybe a third set that it takes at least three or four days for that muscle to recover. Now I realize some people recover much more quickly, but I feel like most people don't. So for me it's always been hard to wrap my head around three times a week training unless people are not going to failure or they're switching up the movement so that the muscles are being targeted differently each time.

2 (22m 4s):
First of all, there's what you're saying about most people. You're in, you're insinuating that people have different recovery, Genetics and there's research on that. There's pump, some people experience way more muscle damage than others and some people have like a recovery gene, like I'm sure there's

0 (22m 21s):
Really, they just recovered quickly.

2 (22m 22s):
Yeah, it's an old paper,

0 (22m 23s):
But I don't, I don't have that gene.

2 (22m 24s):
I don't have it either clearly. And I'm very envious of people who do because the, the listeners, you'll, you'll probably have people split in half people going, I can do these crazy marathon workouts and the next day I'm not even sore and other people like you and I going, I get so sore. I wish I could but it, but here's the thing, you could train it three times a week. You have to adjust the variables. If you're always training when you're fatigued and beat up, you're never gonna get stronger. So you might have to adjust the variables. You and I might not be able to do as many sets as we could when we were 23. You know what I mean? Now that we're approaching 50, we have to do a little bit less volume.

2 (23m 5s):
Maybe we can't train three times a week, but we could train twice a week. But everyone's unique. But in general, everyone can recover from two times a week. But you might not be able to recover if you do, you know, touch and go deadlifts, you know, to failure being like where you're maintaining really good form. But some people can just round their backs and keep going. And then the next day you feel like you got hit by a bus. And it's, a lot of times it's the muscle damage. But it, it might not just be muscle damage, it could be connective tissue, it could be fascia and other, you know, structures too that are just, if they're damaged, it signals the central nervous system. Hey, don't maximally recruit these muscles.

2 (23m 46s):
So if, if pain inhibits muscle activation damage, it's probably a wise, you know, evolutionary strategy for the body to say, Hey, chill, you're not recovered yet. Let's, let's limit the gas pedal. How, how much? You know, let's put the brakes on a little bit so this person can't keep hurting themselves. But you want to be recovered. So you sometimes have to adjust the variables, which are exercise selection. That's probably the most important. Volume, effort, how hard you push yourself. These are the, these are your tools. Program design is an awesome concept and it's a, there's an art to this. We have a lot of science, but there's an art to combining them all. And that's why like strength training is an applied science.

2 (24m 26s):
It's very, it's, that's why it's fun for me. There's an art to this and you can't just read a research, like a review paper and be like, oh here's how, here's how everyone should train. But could you recover from hitting a muscle three times a week? You mentioned that you want your hamstrings to grow. You know, you could do two sets of lying leg curls three times a week, especially if you stopped your sets to reps. Shy of failure, lying leg curls don't beat you up as much. It's when you throw in the stiff leg deadlifts, the good mornings, even seated leg curls the way we did it yesterday where I enhanced the eccentric and made it harder on the way down and really made you upright in that seated leg curl position. So you gotta stretch on the hamstrings.

2 (25m 7s):
That tends to create a little more damage. So some of these exercises that give you the most bang for your buck and they're the most efficient exercises. They sometimes aren't the best exercises if you're training them a muscle frequently. And I like to, I like to say walking lunges are probably the best Glute exercise there is. The problem is they're too good if you really go to failure where you can't get another step with a, you know, they, they can beat you up a lot. If you do three or four sets to failure and then you're trying to train legs two days later, there's no way like you'll be so sore, it'll be counterproductive. That's why like step ups more than lunges not 'cause I think they're more effective, they're just more conducive to training a muscle frequently.

2 (25m 50s):
And this doesn't get talked about enough. There's an art to training frequently. So when men, we grew up in the, we're almost the same age. We're both 49 right now. We grew up where bodybuilders trained legs one day a week, you know, everyone trained. You had your body part split routine where you train a muscle one day and then you damage the hell out of it and you need a whole week to recover the ex The the workouts back then were like four sets of squats, four sets of stiff leg dead Lifts, four sets of leg press, four sets of leg extensions, and then maybe two types of leg curls or something. And then you'd be annihilated for the whole week. Can that work? Yes. The body boat has got big legs back then, but I think better results are seen when you don't go so crazy.

2 (26m 36s):
So you're saying, okay, my girls train their night, my programs and my Glute squad. I have one in San Diego, one in Florida. They train their legs, they train lower body three times a week. They do one squat pattern or squat lunge pattern per workout. Yep. One and three sets. But when I train them in person, it's typically two sets. 'cause I push them harder and we have a goal in mind. And also what I've realized is I typically only push them really hard during their first exercise. 'cause I realize if I sit there and hover over them for all four exercises, well three of the exercises are hard. One's a squat lunge pattern. One's a hinge pull movement, meaning a type of deadlift, stiff leg deadlift, good morning or a 45 degree hyper or reverse hyper.

2 (27m 17s):
And then, and then you have your thrust bridge pattern where it's either a Hip Thrust or a Glute bridge. And we have lots of different Hip Thrust tools, but those don't create as much muscle damage because you're training the glutes in a shortened position anyway. They don't, the, the squat lung hits your quads, glutes and adductors. The hinge hits your hamstrings and glutes. The thrust mainly just works the glutes. And then you throw in an abduction movement at the end, which is Glute medias or upper Glute max. And they, and they, that tends to be recco. You can recover from that. Also, I wanna mention women can recover a little bit better than men. The research is mixed. But having trained men and women, my whole like for literally like 30 years now, I will tell you women recover better.

2 (28m 4s):
Like I don't need studies to tell me that they can do a little more volume. Also, it might matter if you're on a specialization routine, meaning men we're hitting our traps, we're hitting all three heads of our doubts, we're hitting all the muscles in the body. So the, the, a lot of the women, they, their upper body workouts, if they train full body, they might just do an up a compound or multi-joint upper body press and pull and that's it.

0 (28m 30s):
No direct arm work, for instance.

2 (28m 32s):
A lot of them, yeah, because they

0 (28m 33s):
Don't want their arms to grow.

2 (28m 35s):
They don't care as much as men do about arms. They, and they're gonna get decent arm development focusing on one upper body press and one upper body pole. But do that three times a week. We might do 36 sets a week for glutes. And you think, oh my god, that's so much, it's 12, 12. I mentioned the four patterns. So you got your squat, lunge, hinge, pull, thrust bridge, and then your abduction. And those can be in any order. Sometimes we prioritize the squat lunge, sometimes the hinge some, and it makes it fun 'cause it's fun to pr on your favorite type of squat or hack squat or lunge or whatever. And then the next month we might prioritize a hinge, but you're always doing all three of 'em.

2 (29m 17s):
But where you know you're going for PRS on one of the movement patterns each time and then you mix it up throughout the, that that's my system. That tends to work well there's a million ways to do to do it, but anyway, you can recover from that because it doesn't beat you up so much. But there's rules to it. You alternate with the squat lunge pattern, you alternate with a bilateral and unilateral because the unilateral tend to get you more sore. Yeah.

0 (29m 40s):
Could you clarify? Bilateral unilateral

2 (29m 42s):
Bilateral is double leg or d double like two, two limbs at a time and then un unilateral single, single arm or single leg, like

0 (29m 52s):
Rear foot elevated

2 (29m 53s):
Squat. Yeah, squat. So the rear foot of the split squat or the Bulgarian split squat, they tend to get you more sore in the muscles then. And, and also vertical hinges meaning deadlifts and good mornings where it's a vertically loaded compared to like 45 degree hypers where you're kind of at an angle, the 45 degree works you a little bit more at shorter muscle lanes, not as much in the stretch. So you can recover from those a little bit easier. With my system, we tend to alternate. You don't try to do r dls and good mornings three times a week. That would be overkill. There's so many ways to do things, but that's how you make it recoverable. And then if you have a client that's like, I'm beat up all the time, I'm, I'm feel like I'm not recovering, let's reduce the sets.

2 (30m 36s):
Okay, I don't want you training as close to failure. Let's switch the exercises. You're doing Smith machine reverse lunges and they're annihilating you. Let's see if you can do a Glute dominant step up where you're leaning forward. And it works for all the muscle groups too. It's like Dels, I prioritize Dels the last year and I feel like they grew, I wanted to do more dealt volume, but if you, if I just do dumbbell ladder raises all the time and I'm always going for Progressive Overload on them, I start heaving, I start, it starts kind of irritating my joints a little bit, but I've found that cable, cable ladder raises don't beat me up as much, but I will use dumbbells machines, cable columns, even bands.

2 (31m 19s):
You can do band exercise. Those work you most in the squeeze position. They don't create as much muscle damage. So you use this knowledge to maximize your recoverable volume. MRV is, it's this concept of maximum recover bo volume. You wanna do as much volume as possible, but still recovering from it.

0 (31m 37s):
Okay, this is an, an extremely important concept that most people I believe have not heard of. Certainly in exercise science circles, I, I'm sure everybody knows, but maximal recoverable volume. I think this is so critical because it frames basically everything we've been talking about up until now. And I also think it can help clarify a lot of confusion for people in particular, people that are starting to do resistance training and want to better understand what works and what doesn't work over time, both men and women, but also experience lifters because my sort of weaning and understanding around res resistance training came from, you know, the high intensity folks, okay, there's years ago, and this can be basically summarized as you warm up, you do a super intense focused set, maybe two, maybe three, and then you maybe do that for another muscle group and then you take a couple days off and then come in and train other muscles and really you're hitting each muscle directly once per week very intensely, both with mental focus and with physical, you know, intensity obviously.

0 (32m 44s):
And then you leave it alone and you try and get stronger every single workout. That was kind of the, the, the idea. Nowadays I'm hearing a lot more about the kinds of things you're describing, like training each muscle group two or three times per week, dividing upper and lower body. So not dividing the body up is finally into like chest and back one day, shoulders and arms another day, legs another day, and so forth and doing a lot more volume, but maybe not going to failure and certainly changing exercises each workout. So these two things, obviously they both can work. I, I think what we were talking about this yesterday, they both can work, but there was this additional kind of element to it that i, I wanna frame up here, which was the idea from Mike Menser and, and Arthur Jones of, you know, and all the Nautilus folks that really believed in these really brief, super high intensity infrequent workouts was one that I do think is true, at least in my experience, which is as you gain more experience with resistance training, you are able to generate more directed intensity.

0 (33m 44s):
Not like coming into the gym with more energy, but being able to really focus your mind and energy onset, let's just say like a, an a pull up rather than just trying to get one's chin over the bar, which is what we do early on when we're trying to get pull-ups and then just count pull-ups. You drag yourself slowly out of the bottom position, paying attention to really using your lats and not using the biceps. So like focusing on elbowing some behind you. You get to the top, you try and bring the bar to your chest or even lower to like the, you know, for lack of a better way to put to the nipples. And then really squeezing the lats and then lowering yourself slowly. This is very different than trying to rep out chin-ups. And the idea always was that doing things in a more focused way comes with experience that it, the, the beginner can't generate that kind of intensity.

0 (34m 30s):
They don't know how to do the movements, which led me at least to believe that at the beginning when somebody's in their, say first four to six months of training, that a bit more volume is necessary in order to really learn how to do the movements properly, really develop the mind muscle connection, really understand how to train without getting hurt and really learn what that MRV, we didn't know that concept back then, but really learn, you know, okay, I can train my legs twice per week, it's fine, but if I go to three times I'm, I start getting weaker in my workouts, not stronger. Or if you're like me, I can train my legs once per week really intensely, but you know what?

0 (35m 11s):
Not every muscle in my legs is growing the same way. Maybe I need to do twice a week for hamstrings because one muscle group is lagging. So the reason I'm, I'm sort of spooling out this essay here is that I think there's a lot of confusion for people about where to start and where to go. And MRV seems like it, it should be the, the kind of governing factor, the compass in all of this. So for instance, if a client walks into your gym, and let's just say she, because you train a lot of female clients, but this could be also a man talking about chest training, but let's talk about a woman comes in and she just says, listen, I don't wanna be big, right? This is common what you hear, but I really want my glutes to be a bit bigger and I would like to see some Abs and you know, and I, and she's athletic, you know, she's done cardio, done maybe a sport, maybe played some soccer, but she wants to really focus on her glutes and her quads.

0 (36m 8s):
What do you do to assess MRV? Are you looking for her to get stronger every single workout? Or do you spend two or three weeks just like teaching her the movements? Do you spend two or three weeks teaching a guy, Hey, you know what, you think you can do a biceps curl, but let's do a biceps curl where you really learn to activate the biceps at the beginning of the movement. You're not swinging your elbow forward, you're, you're, you're contracting the biceps. Let's really learn how to bring like your pinky higher than your thumb at the top and really learn how to cramp that thing down. That to me is a skill. It's something that requires time and it, and it eats into recovery. So the, the bigger question in here is how do you determine MRV and is skill and ability in being able to target muscles a factor in MRV?

0 (36m 54s):
Because to me it seems like the most important factor. Forgive the long question.

2 (36m 59s):
So yeah, that's the hard thing about working with people online compared to in person online, you kind of have to have a generic cookie cutter approach in person. You can individualize it and assess where they are. If I, if I have a beginner, yes, I agree with you, they benefit from more volume to have the motor learning and gain the coordination. Also, you should, like I remember standing in the mirror as when I was like 15, 16-year-old Flexing and I'm like, I can't, how do I flex my lats? How do I flex my, if you can't flex your muscles, how can you flex your muscles against resistance? Like

0 (37m 32s):
Super important point. Yeah, I mean, I'm just gonna highlight, I'm interrupting you to highlight that If folks, if you can't contract a muscle without a weight in your hand or on your back or whatever it is, you're not going to be able to properly train that muscle.

2 (37m 46s):
So you can use what Mel sif back in the, his a legendary sports entity, he passed away too soon, but he wrote the book super training, but all of us strength coaches back in the day, that was our bible and, and he called it Loadless Training. But yeah, you, you wanna to flex and que but then after a while you don't need to do that. You can, you can use that, you can feel that muscle doing any movement if you want. Do

0 (38m 9s):
You think people could do a self test for instance, where just on their own in their bathroom with no one around, they could just kind of walk from, you know, calves up, you know, just not walk physically but just move from calves up. Like, can you flex your calf on both sides? Can you generate a hard contraction? Can you do that for your quad? Can you do that for your hamstring? Absolutely. Yeah. That to me seems like the most important thing to do before touching a weight or a machine. Because then one can get a real sense of, you know, what kind of neuromuscular control do they have? Because it's gonna vary by sports, by injury history, by Genetics, by all sorts of things, right?

2 (38m 45s):
Men probably have an advantage with when they start out because you know, when we were going through puberty and you're like, oh wow, my body's changing and you no one was looking and you're in the mirror. I remember every,

0 (38m 55s):
Every dude flexes is, is is biceps, he

2 (38m 58s):
Biceps. And you're like, you, you practice Flexing. Well that's, that's training, that's resistance training. You're Flexing your muscles, you're pr you're providing the resistance, you know, and there's some evidence that you can Gain Muscle that way. There's a classic study by Brittany Counts, you know, where with the biceps where one one side used a dumbbell, the other arm just body weight just like concentrating, using no load forceps of 20, Flexing your arm throughout the range of motion trying to squeeze your biceps. And interestingly, this arm grew the triceps because you're using your triceps to provide some of the re

0 (39m 34s):
The no

2 (39m 35s):
Weight arm. Yeah, the no weight arm. And so

0 (39m 37s):
That's pretty wild.

2 (39m 38s):
Yeah. So, so you can, but then how, but then

0 (39m 42s):
I'm not suggesting that's the training people stick with, right? I mean this is sort of like an assessment. An

2 (39m 46s):
Assessment self assessment. Yeah. If you can't feel your muscles, you know, if you can't flex your body, it's, it's kind of hard to like, how do I flex my delts just standing here? But like, yeah, you, you start twe tweaking the body and contorting and you're like, oh, I can feel my delts when I do this. Flaring your lats. That took me some time back, you know, 30 years ago when I started. And then you start to realize, oh, and then another thing, sometimes you go to a gym that doesn't have a lot of equipment or you're limited in loading and you're like, you know, I'm gonna do lat pull downs. And you figure out, wow, I, I feel my lats more doing it this way. Li lifting is a lifelong journey. You can always be improving your form, you can always be learning new skills, but in the beginning, yes, you wanna learn how to flex your muscles, you wanna learn how to perform the exercise with good form, gain the coordination factor, the neuro gains.

2 (40m 35s):
Then over time, most of your gains in strength will come from the muscle growing from Hypertrophy.

0 (40m 41s):
I think these are incredibly informative things to do because then when you arrive in the gym, perhaps you put more priority on the muscles that you have a harder time contracting.

2 (40m 52s):
Well the, this was like proposed by this researcher, Vladimir Yonda, janda whatever, and, and kind of got trickled down. I know Stu McGill, you've had him on the show. He started talking about Glute amnesia and then it gets a lot of backlash because people are like, oh, you really have Glute amnesia. Your glutes don't activate at all. But what we're talking about is some muscles, and I, and I learned this from doing EMG electromyography testing back in the day. I'm like, man, when people walk upstairs, their quad activation is through the roof. When you just stand up from the couch, quad activation through the roof, Glute activation doesn't get very high during everyday normal movements.

2 (41m 33s):
So they're probably more prone to atrophy and you know, disuse, you're just gonna, the muscle will shrink. You're also not activating as much. Why would the neural gains be as efficient? And then probably there's a genetic element too with your anatomy and with your sport history and stuff. So there's kinda like neural, think of it as neural programming. I know Glute activation gets a lot of flack from people 'cause it got so popular back, they low Load Glute Activation. It's funny 'cause I'm a personal trainer, but my roots come up as a strength coach. I wanted to, I wanted to work with athletes earlier in my career. And I think that's what differentiated me from all these co these bodybuilding coaches have a different mindset.

2 (42m 18s):
I have a more of a functional outlook on things, but also we were doing Glute low Load Glute Activation back in the day. And there were all these coaches, the popular strength coaches were doing it in the early two thousands up until the late two thousands. What's

0 (42m 31s):
Low Load Glute Activation?

2 (42m 33s):
You're using lower loads body weight or bands and you're just doing like, you know, movements trying to, you're not going to failure. It's not a working set. You do it in the, in the general warmup, you know that your dynamic warmup, you might be able to do a hundred Glute bridges, but you're doing two sets of 10 trying to really squeeze the Glute field of moving you lateral band walks, things like that. So we were doing that in the early two thousands to wake up the glutes. And there is evidence of this though. It's, there's a, there's probably 15 studies on it may like key studies. A lot of 'em show no benefit, but a couple of them show definitely definite neural gains.

2 (43m 13s):
Like one study just in one week that people doing like an hour a day of isometric, like a, on all fours, you put a band around the knees and you did like a kind of this weird movement where it's like hip extension, abduction, external rotation at the same time kind of lifting your leg out to the side.

0 (43m 28s):
So sort of like a dog peeing?

2 (43m 29s):
Yeah, almost like a fire hydrant but also extending.

0 (43m 31s):
It's called a fire hydrant.

2 (43m 33s):
The fire hydrant movie.

0 (43m 33s):
Oh. Like, 'cause like a dog pee

2 (43m 35s):
On fire, you on your fourth and you lift a leg up. Yeah. All right. Yep. But they, they want it to be isometric 'cause they thought isometric you're focusing, you're using the brain

0 (43m 42s):
Isometric focuses where you're, you're pausing the movement typically in the fully contracted position, but you know where you're holding the movement and really trying to contract the muscle. So the, there's obviously you gotta get the knee up to pee on the fire hydrant. Yeah. But then you're holding it there and really trying to contract.

2 (43m 57s):
So you did, they try to do like 20 minutes three times a day for a whole week. Like that's crazy. 20

0 (44m 2s):
Minutes of isometric holding.

2 (44m 3s):
So it was like, as much as you can tolerate, but three times a day for a whole week. 'cause they did this study in one week, but in one week they showed significant. I don't know all the terms. 'cause this is the, the, you would know these terms, the neural side, you would know the neural side. We could

0 (44m 15s):
Just, it's

2 (44m 16s):
The motor cortex. You one

0 (44m 18s):
Way or another, there's a strengthening of the neural connection.

2 (44m 20s):
Yeah, the brain, the, the, the air in the brain, the motor cortex responsible for activating the Glute saw increases in just one week. But it's obvious, like it's obvious you can improve that side of things. So, but then here's the thing about what we're talking about. People get carry carried away. You can get sidetracked. MRV can, can distract you. People get obsessive with the number of sets. The main thing is, are you gaining strength? And I don't mean all time prs every single, like especially if you're in lifting for a lot of years, like you and me, can we keep going up in strength? But you set a baseline on week one and can you gain strength for three weeks in a row after that and then you switch, then you start a baseline.

2 (45m 3s):
Can you gain strength then? Are you kind of moving up over time? You know, you set it yesterday that it's gonna be a jigs, what did you call it? A SOB and it

0 (45m 12s):
A up into the right sawtooth pattern.

2 (45m 15s):
Sawtooth pattern. But up into the right over time are you making gains? And that's where I've, I've been heavily influenced by strength co a powerlifting coach who passed away Louis Simmons. I really liked the idea that his, his powerlifters were like, you know, platform ready year round. They would max out year round. And I'm going, how do you max out on squats, deadlifts, good mornings year round, they'd have one max effort day a week, and then they'd have a dynamic effort day, you know, where they focused on speed or like reps, but it wasn't going crazy. But their max effort day, they, they'd switch it around a lot.

2 (45m 55s):
That's how they could compete year round like that. And you know, a lot of what I do is influenced by him. All of us strength coaches back in the, the late nineties, the early two thousands were, he was our primary influence. We, and you could talk to all the popular strength coaches back when I came up. They would all say they were influenced by Louis Simmons, but he did things a certain way for now I'm going, okay, it makes sense to me now after studying biomechanics, he used a lot of bands and chains that's a little bit easier in the stretch position, a little bit harder in the end range position. He did one max. Everybody is rotating the Lifts every, you know, several weeks. And so that's what I do. But I don't, I'm, I'm not just preparing my clients for power lifting.

2 (46m 38s):
I love the squat, the bench and the deadlift. I also love the military press the chin up and the Hip Thrust. Those are my Big Six Lifts. But we also use leg press. We use whatever machines, tools, whatever suits the clients well, and I help my clients figure out what their favorite exercise are and they, they evolve over time. But here are the tools and we try to set PRS over time, but you switch it around because what you talked about in a previous question, this old nautilus and hip philosophy was, you know, hit a muscle infrequently, hit it hard, recover, blast it, and try to get one more rep or go up five or 10 pounds.

2 (47m 21s):
It, it sounds great in theory, it just doesn't work out in real life.

0 (47m 25s):
You can't get stronger continually over time anyway. Eventually you get

2 (47m 28s):
Hurt. That's the thing. If you just repeat the same exercises, say, say you and I just said, look, let's, let's you know, say we worked out tomorrow together, let's set our baseline with deep squats and stiff leg deadlifts and whatever we hit, we hit, and then we're gonna go up either one more rep or you know, up five or 10 pounds. You know, you, even if we maxed out and said, okay, we're gonna try and get one more rep each week. You won't get, you know, 52 more reps each year, right? You won't get five more pounds each month. That's 60 pounds in a year. You won't keep going up 60 pounds. Maybe you can the first year, maybe the second year, depending on the lift, but after a while, then if that were true in 10 years of lifting, everyone would be doing 600 plus pounds on every exercise.

2 (48m 15s):
It doesn't happen. And that's what people don't talk about with Progressive Overload. You, you gotta talk about this because you can't just keep going up. It doesn't happen. And then it's frustrating when you think you have to Progressive Overload and then you don't get one more rep or you don't get five more pounds or you don't set a pr and then you start getting contorting your form and you start getting joint pain and nagging injuries and then you start going backwards. That's one thing you definitely want to avoid. We talked about this yesterday, is avoiding this pain cycle, avoiding this nagging injury cycle. How do you keep making gains without being hurt? Without being, and that's where you gotta use more variety.

AG1 (48m 53s):
We've known for a long time that there are things that we can do to improve our sleep, and that includes things that we can take. Things like magnesium, three, inate theanine, chamomile extract, and glycine, along with lesser known things like saffron and valerian root. These are all clinically supported ingredients that can help you fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up feeling more refreshed. I'm excited to share that our longtime Sponsor, AG one just created a new product called A GZA nightly drink designed to help you get better sleep and have you wake up feeling super refreshed. Over the past few years, I've worked with the team at AG One to help create this new A GZ formula. It has the best sleep supporting compounds in exactly the right ratios, in one easy to drink mix. This removes all the complexity of trying to forge the vast landscape of supplements focused on sleep and figuring out the right dosages and which ones to take for you. A GZ is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive sleep supplement on the market. I take it 30 to 60 minutes before sleep. It's delicious by the way, and it dramatically increases both the quality and the depth of my sleep. I know that both from my subjective experience of my sleep and because I track my sleep. I'm excited for everyone to try this new A GZ formulation and to enjoy the benefits of better sleep. A GZ is available in chocolate, chocolate mint, and mixed berry flavors. And as I mentioned before, they're all extremely delicious. My favorite of the three has to be, I think, chocolate mint, but I really like them all. If you'd like to try a GZ, go to drink AG gz.com/huberman to get a special offer. Again, that's drink AG z.com/huberman.

LMNT (50m 21s):
Today's episode is also brought to us by element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium in the correct amounts but no sugar. Proper hydration is critical for optimal brain and body function. Even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance. It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes. The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium are vital for functioning of all the cells in your body, especially your neurons or your nerve cells. Drinking element dissolved in water makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes. I dissolve one packet of Element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I first wake up in the morning. And I drink that basically first thing in the morning. I'll also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing, especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes Element has a bunch of great tasting flavors. I love the raspberry, I love the citrus flavor. Right now, element has a limited edition lemonade flavor that is absolutely delicious. I hate to say that I love one more than all the others, but this lemonade flavor is right up there with my favorite other one, which is raspberry or watermelon. Again, I can't pick just one flavor. I love them all. If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drink element.com/huberman, spelled drink LMNT dot com slash huberman to claim a free element sample pack with a purchase of any element drink mix. Again, that's drink element.com/huberman to claim a free sample pack.

0 (51m 53s):
Real quick question, and then more about what we're just discussing. You mentioned six Lifts and you rattled them off very fast. I I caught them. People can slow it down, but yeah, I, I heard squat or hip hinge in there. Could you list off the six things that you consider, and I realize there are many, many more exercises, but what are the six that you listed off?

2 (52m 13s):
My top six are squats, bench press, deadlifts, military press, chin-ups, and Hip Thrust. Great. And if you do those six Lifts, so it's like, I loved power lifting, but if you just did the three Lifts, your shoulders might not be maximally developed. Your lats might not max. So you, you might be leaving some Glute, some room for Glute growth on the table. And so this, in my opinion, you're gonna develop all your muscles with these six Lifts,

0 (52m 43s):
Squat, bench, press, deadlift, military press, which is overhead press. Overhead press could be standing, could be seated front of, you know, et cetera. Well then chin and Hip Thrust and, and there could be and variations of this,

2 (52m 54s):
All the variations of those. But let me tell you a lesson I learned in 2020. We have the quarantine, right? We're all so bored

0 (53m 3s):
And stressed.

2 (53m 3s):
People

0 (53m 4s):
Were bored and stressed at the same

2 (53m 5s):
Time. Yeah, I have a gym in San Diego and it's like, I remember like week one of the quarantine. I'm like, okay, I can do this. I, I'm lucky I have a gym. I can go to the gym. I don't have to do these silly body weight workouts that we're telling everyone to do. I can actually still use all the machines and the free weights. And I had my client, Allegra call me coach, you know me, I'm gonna go crazy, you know, my mental health, I have to be lifting weights. I'm like, well, come to the gym with me. Who's gonna know? And then, you know, California was pretty hardcore, but I'm like, I don't want my, you know, I know it was like a, is this a sensitive topic? 'cause people were dying back then. How tragic. But I am a very social person and I'm like, alright, I'm gonna let my clients come and train with me.

2 (53m 52s):
Well, long story short, 2020 was sad enough. Pray the best year of all of our lives. We'll say it was the best year. We lifted weights all day long. 'cause you didn't have to, you weren't so focused on your career back then and posting to Social Media. You were just trying to survive each day. And you weren't even allowed to post on Social Media about like your workouts and stuff. 'cause you weren't supposed to be in a gym. So my clients would come to me for two, three hours a day. Six, six days a week. I was in the gym all day long. And all of a sudden I'm like, Jesus, my clients are getting so freaking strong. They're insane right now. They're so strong. So that's when I thought up the idea of strong lifting, it's like power lifting is the three Lifts.

2 (54m 33s):
Strong lifting is the six Lifts. Those six Lifts I just mentioned. We're gonna start competing. And I did this like psychological trick where I'd have my computer up and I'd have the spreadsheet and I'd, I'd have all my clients' names and all their strength and they'd start looking, 'cause I gave awards out like the, so if you got the absolute best or the relative best strength divided by body weight at any lift. And then we had the total lift and then we had strongest upper body, strongest lower body, strongest pressor, which were squats, military and bench strongest pull, which was chin ups and you know, deadly. So I strongest lower body, strongest upper body.

2 (55m 13s):
We could mix it around. I had like 55 awards I'd give out. But the point was, p the, the women would go like my clients, like a Amanda would be like, Carly just hit a pr. Ugh, I gotta beat her. Like they got competitive with it. And so they, were

0 (55m 28s):
They training these every single day of those six days per week?

2 (55m 31s):
No, I would say we did kind of like the lower upper, lower upper, lower. 'cause they wanted to come in every day. They were bored to death. So we'd have three lower body days and we would do probably a variation of each. But you'd, some days it would be like we're trying to hit squat really hard. Some days we're trying to deadlift hard. You can't squat deadlift and you could Hip Thrust hard three times a week. That works. You in the short, the squeeze position. It doesn't beat you up as much. But as we started getting stronger at deadlifts, we realized some things we were doing touch and go. Meaning you bounce the weight up, you don't reset, you don't set the weight down, reset it, then lift it up.

2 (56m 11s):
You're stronger when you do touch and go compared to reset reps. I remember my client Ashley Hodge hits three 15 for 18 reps and like Dominique gets at three 15 for 11 reps and, and it's the environment's crazy. We have their PR song going on, you know, what song do you want to hear? It's, it's, it's, you know, blaring it at max volume and you have 10 20 of your lifting partners, your colleagues around going, come on, you got it. Come on the, the videos back then were crazy and they're hitting these crazy prs. And then they say to me, coach, I don't know, cool. I set a deadlift pr a touch and go PR and then I'm sore for my next week and a half is shot.

2 (56m 53s):
It can take, when you're really training that kind of psychological arousal when you're training that hard and doing like some Lifts like, like that hack squat you have at your place. It's, it's more horizontal. You can keep going with it. If I'm there going, come on Andrew, you got this. Keep going. You get, you get in some zone, there's some Lifts where you can just keep going and then it annihilates you so bad, your knees are sore for a week. So we kinda realize then we're not gonna train with that. We're not gonna yell in each other. We're not gonna train with music. It beats you up too much. We're not gonna do touch and go, we're gonna do reset reps and we're gonna do lower reps with stricter form. 'cause they beat you up too much. So we learned during the, when we were training for it, we learned some stuff can beat you up too much.

2 (57m 37s):
And you don't know that until you've hit it. You, until you've worked that hard and you got really strong. Most of the listeners, you know, Ashley Hodge weighed 130 pounds and hit three 15 for 18. Now she's even stronger. But you don't, most people never train that hard. Most people need to train harder. Then there's the category that people who train too hard. What we now know is that that Arthur Jones back in the day, the the Mike Menzer approach hit once all outset to failure. That probably is the most efficient way to train, the most economical way to train. You're in the gym, you can be in the gym 45 minutes twice a week and make good gains.

2 (58m 18s):
The problem is it leads to injuries over time. If you don't swap, rotate the exercise and you don't have to perform every set to failure. In fact, there's some evidence now emerging that you can get just as much Hypertrophy, similar strength gains. But like you might wanna leave a rep or two in the tank and do a little more volume. So everything's very nuanced. But when I moved away from San Diego, I moved to Vegas. My, now my squad is left to train on their own. Well I was always there to watch them, you know, and so if, if, if, if I'm training you Andrew, and you're like, coach my, my low back feels a little off and then I'm going, okay, we're not deadlifting today.

2 (58m 60s):
Or if you're like, my, my knee feels weird today. Okay, we're not gonna squat today. We're gonna do this instead I'm there to swap it out. But if, if I'm not there and you push yourself through it and you do that for a few weeks now it becomes a chronic problem and it takes a long time to go away. So now my clients are getting with me not being there, they're getting injured more often. They start developing nagging low back pain and things like that. So now I've learned to, I still love strong lifting, but we, you need to, you can't just keep getting stronger at the main Barbell Lifts week in, week out. You've gotta introduce more variety. You have to. So we now cycle things around and we stray, but we, we still, it's still about Progressive Overload, but we incorporate more machines.

2 (59m 42s):
More like you said, overhead press. It could be dumbbells, it could be smith machine, it could be Barbell, it could be seated staining. But you can pick a lift like what Louis Simmons would do back in the day. You can pick a lift and get stronger at it for a few weeks, you know, for a month and then recycle it. So we're always using Progressive Overload, but you can't always just go set all time prs every week in the gym. It doesn't work that way. And that's the hardest thing to instill into people is this topic of Progressive Overload. What does that look like over the long haul? What does it look like over a 30 year lifting career?

0 (1h 0m 16s):
One of the things that I've done as the years have gone by in order to generate Hypertrophy and strength increases, but not necessarily by always trying to add more weight, is to change my mindset around lifting. Where after a couple of warmups do the work sets, typically for me that's two to four work sets per exercise. Generally it's two, occasionally three, rarely four. But the idea is to make the final reps of each set, each work set that is as difficult as possible. It's completely transformed my progress in the last, I would say two or three years where I'm making more progress in the last two or three years than I did in the previous eight.

0 (1h 1m 5s):
Despite having been at the resistance training thing for a long time and not really changed much else. So the idea is always trying to do repetitions in really good form. Always trying to isolate the muscles that I'm trying to target for compound movements. I'm not trying to isolate one muscle obviously, but to execute the movements properly in the case of compound movements. And then as the set gets harder and I can, okay, you know, failure is approaching somewhere to stop counting repetitions and just focus extremely hard on the form and execution and the targeting of the muscles. So that a lot of times I don't even really know how many repetitions I did, of course I know how much weight I'm moving, but I just keep telling myself, make it harder, not easier, make it harder, not easier in the final two to three repetitions of the set.

0 (1h 1m 53s):
Sometimes I'll go to failure where I can't move the weight anymore, sometimes I get close to it and just stop. And I've noticed that for me this is translated to better strength and Hypertrophy increases, but also just better ability to execute the movements and far fewer little nagging aches and pains and things like that. So it's been an inversion of the mindset of like complete, you know, complete X number of repetitions at a given weight, then increase it every couple weeks or every workout ideally. You know, my mindset is nope, I'm going into the gym to use the weights as a tool to generate adaptation, strengthen Hypertrophy increases and I'm going to make each work set as hard as possible by making the final two or three reps harder and resist the temptation to move the weight just to complete more repetitions.

0 (1h 2m 42s):
I just would like your reflections on that 'cause I'm actually interested in getting better at what I'm doing and I imagine that is useful. But you're probably gonna tell me that there are times when I should just actually try and max out the number of repetitions I can do. Well

2 (1h 2m 55s):
I watched you lift yesterday and I, and you do a good job of that. So there are people who use sloppy technique and you come in and as a coach, you know, oh god, I gotta really clean up the way they lift their form, their Tempo. Then there are people who are really, really strict and you're like, okay, you could benefit from you typically with women you'll see this with like people who are real big on yoga and Pilates and then they come to lift weights and they think everything needs to be so slow and controlled and, and this is gonna be a shock to the listeners. Tempo doesn't affect Hypertrophy that much. You can have like a one second repetition and an eight second repetition and it builds muscle similarly really.

2 (1h 3m 38s):
And it blows people's mind 'cause they go, what? You don't have to control the negative. You can't just like let the weights crash down, but as long as you're, you are controlling the weights on the way down. Also the lift matters. Some Lifts are less range of motion. Like are you, like I used to laugh at when I'd see people, this is how you know who's really a coach and who's not. When you see them prescribe an exercise and you're like, do this with a two second concentric and four second eccentric six seconds per rep and it's like a shrug, imagine what that would look like. Shrugs are like explosive, you know, one second per rep if that, you know, some Lifts are just quicker.

2 (1h 4m 19s):
And then if you, if you see that they prescribed a set of 12 and it and it's a, you know, six second, okay, six times 12 a 72, you're, that's a 72 second set. And then you're telling them, and it's a say, it's a step up. So you got one leg, then you go right in the next leg and then you're saying rest one minute you'd be breathing so fast you would not have a productive second set. But I digress. I think Tempo matters mostly for longevity. If you're just like being very erratic and so explosive and not controlling the weight, you have a big better chance of getting injured over time. And so I think Tempo is more important for Hypertrophy in the long run by preventing injury.

2 (1h 5m 3s):
My clients, they will do Hip Thrust explosively and people will say, you gotta control the weight on the way down. Well there aren't a lot of, there aren't tons of studies on this topic, but it appears that they're wrong. You can explode up, you can lower it slowly, I mean lower it quickly or you can go a lot lighter and really control it. I, it makes more sense to me to try to explode at the bottom and like really Right, but you wanna control it, but you want to use that explosion because you're trying to create maximum force in the stretch position, the bottom position. But then you still want to use full range and control it the whole way and maybe have a brief little pause at the top.

2 (1h 5m 43s):
But that, but yeah, people get too strict on Tempo. And those are the same types that, that when they're, they're so focused on Tempo and form and feeling that you don't use Progressive Overload like what you just said. You don't even count it. You don't even know how many reps you did, but you saw results this way. So a lot of times people see results just from doing something different. You and I talked about how when you were in your teens learning how to lift weights, you were influenced right away by Mike Menzer. So you right away learned how to get your all outta one hard set or like, you know, low volume, low volume training.

2 (1h 6m 24s):
I was the opposite. I learned from Arnold and Arnold and Menzer were like opposing, they actually didn't get along in real life. So I read Arnold's encyclopedia and I'm like, I gotta do all this volume. So I did high volume training for eight years when I was like 24 years old. I started doing low volume training, One Set to Failure. It took me a while to get good at it. I sucked at it initially and then I I you get really good at pushing one, it's a skill you get so much better when you're only doing one set. You get really good at getting your all outta that one set. You mentioned that then you saw good results realizing I can benefit from more volume, doing more sets. Same with when you said I'm gonna focus on making the last reps harder, not not using momentum or body English to squeeze out a couple more to make it easier.

2 (1h 7m 10s):
And you definitely see gains that way. But it's these, it's this concept where something that can get you gains then it can all, it can limit you eventually because your focus is now on. So you're relying on your mind, you're relying now on your mind to use Progressive Overload. Meaning you're not gonna progress with weights. You're gonna try to produce increasing amounts of muscle force through a mind muscle connection, through an internal attentional focus. And in your, you lie to yourself. It's the same as if I don't have my, my, my logbook in front of me and I go, yeah, I I can, I hit three 15 for six last time and then I get it for seven, I get it for seven.

2 (1h 7m 54s):
I'm like, yeah. And then I and I and then I get my, my book and I'm like, oh my god, I hit it for eight. I forgot I could have probably gotten more. That's what I like about taking notes and writing it down. You lie to yourself and you limit yourself and you're like, God, if I knew somehow, if I knew that I had hit hit, I had hit eight before I probably could have hit nine. But the set still felt hard. But we're capable of a lot more. But you gotta be reminded, that's why for my clients I give them Autonomy. So say I'm, we're, we're doing Hip Thrust first and I and they say, coach, what should I do? I al I want them involved in on it. It just, I think things work better when you get them involved. So go, okay, which Hip Thrust do you want do At my gym we do rotisserie, Hip Thrust ramp, Hip Thrust and thruster pro, you won't know what those mean but which Hip Thrust do you wanna do or say It's, say they're doing a squat.

2 (1h 8m 45s):
Do you want to use the Glute builder squat machine 'cause it's really good or do you want to do a Smith machine squat? Do you wanna do a Barbell squat box squat? Do you want to use the T-ball and do the the squat that way? Which squat do you want to do? And I let them choose and they go, let's do, let's do a rotisserie hip or let's do a T-ball squat. Alright, what's your, what are your records? And then they say, well I've done, you know, my record with the t bell squad is I've done a hundred for 16, I've done 1 25. 'cause we load up 25 pound plates on that. I, they are very involved in the process. And I go, okay, which do you want to beat today? And I give them some Autonomy.

2 (1h 9m 26s):
So yes, a lot of my, the coaches listening to this would say, so you only have 'em go hard on one set. You should have them go do three or four sets and then the last set go hard on. But that can work well. And there's also some evidence that you can trade off volume and effort. Meaning if you left three reps in the tank but did an extra two sets, that might be equal to doing a couple less sets. But go training to failure. There's some evidence that, but I'm just saying my system, I want them focused on Progressive Overload. And when they have Autonomy and they say, okay coach, I think I want to go for the 1 25 for a seven, I want to get eight. All right, let's do it.

2 (1h 10m 7s):
And then you're focused on it and then you go all out, you hit eight, great. They set a pr. Now I'm not gonna follow 'em through the rest of the workout. Now get your volume in, but you achieve the goal. Everything else is icing on the cake. You achieve that goal. People don't understand how hard it's to continue use, you know, to keep using progressive. And most people stop after a year or two, they just quit, quit paying attention. I think you've done that because we get older and you're like, ugh, I can still get awesome workouts. I can still improve my physique. But what you're talking about is using my muscle connection to produce increasing muscle force, putting more mechanical tension on the muscles through your mind. But your mind plays tricks on you. It's not objective.

2 (1h 10m 47s):
What is objective is the load on the bar. But that can play tricks on you too, where you're setting prs but using sloppier form, not controlling it, using a different Tempo or a different range of motion. So that happens too. That's why you gotta have this yin and yang. The external on the internal, like the, the, the Progressive Overload with the mind muscle connection. Those two are the yin and yang that keep each other in check. And those two pathways are necessary to optimize Hypertrophy over the long run.

0 (1h 11m 15s):
Yeah, I definitely pursue Progressive Overload. Still, I should have been clear about this.

2 (1h 11m 21s):
What you're describing is using Progressive Overload, you're just keeping the same weight. But I liked, I used to make, I remember writing an article like 10 different ways you can Progressive Overload And that's just confusing people. No, there's two main ways to progress. Earlier you use the same weight for more reps or more weight for the same reps. But in a way you are using Progressive Overload 'cause you're using the same weight. Not necessarily getting more reps but having more control over it, which does produce more tension on the muscles and can lead to muscle growth over time. It's just, it's not as objective. It requires you to come in fresh and work your hardest and you can, there's no studies on this topic by the way. It would be cool to see one group focus on just on the, the numbers Quantity and the other group focus just on the quality for a whole year.

2 (1h 12m 9s):
And maybe in your first year you might tie, but over the years, like, I don't know, it's,

0 (1h 12m 14s):
I'll tell you who are, who I think will look better. Men and women, I think the people that focus on quality and that raises a a, a new question which

2 (1h 12m 21s):
Was, see I would disagree, I'd say the Quantity group, but this is,

0 (1h 12m 23s):
You mean just heavier for more reps

2 (1h 12m 24s):
Either beating the reps or the load. But, 'cause I think people can get too caught up on quality to where they never go heavier and they're cool, you're cool.

0 (1h 12m 35s):
Well this is your, this is your area of study, so you would, I trust your answer,

2 (1h 12m 38s):
But people will agree with you on like, it'll be divided if, if if you put up a pull, what do you guys think about this? You'd have 50% say quality and then 50% say Quantity because the, and and over the long run Quantity leads to injuries. And we don't talk about this enough because it's like the, the, the typical bros in their twenties that are like just squat deadlift and you know, okay, how does that pan out 30 years? You, 20 years from now when you've been, you know, lifting, you don't, they don't even understand they haven't gotten there. You have to have the nagging pain that you were like, ugh, okay, should I deadlift today or should I do you know, single leg r dls or like a seated leg curl.

0 (1h 13m 20s):
I have a, a thought around the role of the gym and training and recovery as it relates to how one feels outside of the gym. Okay. I don't think I'm alone in this, although I've never heard anyone bring this up as a kind of like formally introducing the topic, which is for many people, including myself, the reason I train three times a week, different body parts each time I train is because I also like to run. The other reason is I love to train, but after three or four days a week of resistance training, I'm not as excited to resistance train. I wanna arrive in the gym, excited to resistance train.

0 (1h 14m 0s):
I also have other things in my life. And it's not just a matter of time. If I'm training with the kind of intensity and Frequency to maximize Hypertrophy, a lot of times I'm tired, you know, I, I I need more, a bit more sleep and I'm not gonna get that sleep. I have a very, very full life. You know, I often say my dance card is very full and I think I'm not alone in this. So I feel like for a lot of people, the ideal Training Frequency for them has something to do with yes, they want bigger glutes and yes they want to be leaner and yes, they're willing to work hard in the gym, but that they also have to acknowledge like the real wi real Life Constraints.

0 (1h 14m 41s):
Like how often are they really able to train five days a week, maybe in certain phases of the year they are. But I found to be very beneficial to kind of set a, a minimum of three workouts per week in the gym resistance training, two or three cardio workouts per week and then stay with that and adjust the intensity and do these various things that we're talking about so that I wake up in the morning feeling pretty fresh so that I can focus when I work so that I'm not, you know, dragging and that I can, you know, like carry my luggage through the airport like I had to do the other day without feeling like my, my body's gonna explode in pain or, or something like that. Because at some point the gym for many people is the endpoint.

0 (1h 15m 24s):
But I think for far more people, the gym is a tool to create a body that can do things in the outside world, including feel refreshed. And so that's why when we started off today and you said, well in principle one could get away with training once per week, whole body, but you'd have to put so much intensity, you probably feel like garbage for the next two or three days and then pretty good for the remainder of the week. Maybe divide that into like two or three workouts, right? Or this lower upper, lower upper, lower sounds great but five days a week of training, even if it's, you know, varying the Lifts, et cetera. Just even like commuting the same way to the gym. I don't wanna sound overly lazy here, but again, people have stuff to do. It would be awesome if people would look at their schedule I think and say, you know, how many days a week can I go to the gym and really put real work into it, Progressive Overload, focus, training, all these things, how much time can I really dedicate to that?

0 (1h 16m 16s):
And then back engineer the ideal split and way to work out from there. Does, is that something that is, it seems, I, I just wanna check myself on this. I'm not proposing this as much as I just, you know, want your thoughts on this. As, as a trainer has trained so many people and including people who are not physique athletes and, and just like people who want to like have a great shaped body, be lean, be strong, live a long time, feel awesome.

2 (1h 16m 41s):
Well I think what you're talking about is so important. Like yesterday we were in your gym working out and you know, you you you took a shower and came out in a towel, peeled down, you have ripped Abs. Some people don't know this about you. You look amazing. You're 49 years old, you've been lifting weights since you were 16. 16. Same here. We've both been lifting weights for 33 years. We started when we were 16. We're both 49. You can learn a thing for a, a thing or two from us. You know why? Because we didn't fizzle out. You know, we didn't fizzle out over, over time. And that's what you get a lot of gung-ho people that are like trained five, six days a week, spend two, three hours a day in the gym, they don't last.

2 (1h 17m 21s):
So there's this what's best for short term Hypertrophy. What's optimal? You can, we can geek out over what's optimal. But the main thing is what's gonna keep you motivated also, you're not, you're not going to, if, if you train, even training five days a week is tough. My, my, my clients will typically have like typically on Friday, if they hit it too hard on Monday and Wednesday and then they're trying to hit lower body on Friday and they're, this happens to a lot of 'em. Coach, I'm beat down today. I'm just gonna do kickbacks and abduction and keep it light. And I go, that's fine. Guess what? They come back on Monday crushing it. They had to do a wimpy workout and then they take Saturday and Sunday off.

2 (1h 18m 1s):
They come back again on Monday ready to rock and roll. You have to make adjustments when you're training frequently when you're training one or two days a week. You don't have to make that many adjustments 'cause you're recovered. The more frequently you train, the more adjustments you have to make. You have to auto-regulate based on biofeedback meaning like, you just gotta listen to your body and and stray from the plan. But what you're saying is you start feeling overwhelmed. You're not as psyched when you start trying to lift four or five times a week. 'cause you also like to be functional. You sprint, you run, you have a life and you've learned that three days a week is what the optimal Frequency for you, you and your lifestyle and you look amazing.

2 (1h 18m 45s):
And so you've figured that out. Most people don't ever figure that out. They don't think they just are these rote, you know, robots going through life taking and they don't think for themselves. And so that's what I encourage people, you're gonna see way better results training two days a week, but you're psyched up, you're recovered, you're feeling you want to, you're itching to go to the gym compared to if you train six times a week and you're always sore, you're beat up, you're dreading it. You you don't use progressive or you just go through the motions and it's just to check off a box and you're, you're not gonna see many gains that way. So you're absolutely right that your psych, I always say we talk about anatomy and physiology and we ignore the psych, the psychology component, the psychological component is huge and that gets ignored and I try to help people tune into that as a, as a coach.

2 (1h 19m 34s):
And I try to stray from like, I have my system, but I've, I've had great gains, you know, like with people's strength far from the norms. I remember this client Sammy, I had in 20 20 13, and I'm like, she's the strongest one of the group. She, I started training six bikini competitors all at once outta my, I didn't even have a gym at that pie, trained 'em outta my sixth floor condo in Phoenix, Arizona. I smuggled equipment up to my sixth floor when, when the security guards were distracted and, and, and I I I had like, you know, six pieces of equipment and they got so strong. I think Sammy probably doubled her Glute size in six months. But I'm like every mon I only trained her twice a week, Monday, Thursday back then.

2 (1h 20m 17s):
And I'm like, every Thursday her workouts suck and I'm like, oh my God, she's gaining so much strength but every Thursday workout sucks. I'm gonna just give her One Set to Failure and One Set to Failure on of like, so she'd do, she'd do like five or six sets on Monday, five or six sets on on Thursday. And the other girls would go, coach, why, why does she only have to do one set? And I'd go, you can do one set if you want. I think you wanna do more. I don't think you want to do one sec. Most people wanna do more volume, but I'd say it's 'cause she's so strong. She gets, I remember I had this 106 pound kettlebell, they were deadlifting and she

0 (1h 20m 53s):
160 pound kettlebell. No,

2 (1h 20m 54s):
No, no, 106. 106. But she could, she quickly got to where she could do it 50 reps. So I had to buy a 203 pound kettlebell. It looked like a cannon ball. 'cause I, I didn't wanna have like a Barbell in

0 (1h 21m 3s):
Place. This is on the sixth floor of an apartment. Oh my god. No wonder they didn't want you to have weights in there, like drop through the

2 (1h 21m 7s):
Floor. No, I know. And I, and I look back 'cause you still see the video on the YouTube. It's hilarious because I would, the, the, the bench was against my TV stand and I'd travertine tile and I'd put this, I'd pick up this easy bar and sit in their laps and they do Hip Thrust. You see in some of the videos, like this red envelope, like the Netflix, back when we used to order Netflix DVDs, that's how long ago this was. But if they were to drop the weight or their feet slid out, I would've cracked my tile. But anyway, I saw great results just having minimal equipment. But she could gain a lot of strength. But she did best with single sets. And I don't, and there's some, there's one study I remember on the, it was like the ace gene, the angio con angiotensin, oh the, an converting enzyme gene.

2 (1h 21m 52s):
I don't know what the hell that has to do with strength and volume, but there were like different alleles. This is not my field, but like different, different phenotypes or whatever. No phenotype, whatever. Yep. This was years ago when I read this study. But it seemed that some people do better on with lower body doing single sets versus multiple sets. Interesting. And that was, that study was like 12. That study was I think a lot of years ago, maybe like 10, 15-year-old study. But there's probably a, a genetic element to how many sets is optimal for us. But she saw that if I trained, if I had to do three lower body workouts a week, she spun her wheels. Could I have said we're gonna do three, but we're gonna do more sets, way less effort.

2 (1h 22m 34s):
But who likes stopping five reps? Shy of failure.

0 (1h 22m 38s):
Yeah, that's,

2 (1h 22m 39s):
It's hard to do. It's hard to be like, it's

0 (1h 22m 40s):
Hard. It's

2 (1h 22m 40s):
Hard to do when it's easy and you stop people like training serious lifters like training close to failure. And then if someone just generally doesn't, like I, I know there's Genetics to that Exercise Enjoyment, you know, that there's Genetics of everything.

0 (1h 22m 54s):
I mean I love training and it, and part of the reason I set that Frequency at three times per week. I, I've trained four times per week from, you know, from time to time. But is it, I love training and I love making progress and I don't like being in pain. I, I can handle soreness. I can handle pain during the set, during the workout. I'm talking about, I'm talking about like headed towards injury type pain that just, you know, feeling like you can't get up out of bed in the morning 'cause you, you got a strain or something. But I've always loved exercise. I never understood this concept of, you know, I hate working out, but I always feel better afterwards. People say that and I'm always like, I, I wish I could train six days per week. I don't have the time and I, I just can't generate the intensity.

0 (1h 23m 35s):
So you're telling me that there are genetic differences in Exercise Enjoyment. I

2 (1h 23m 39s):
Remember one day I was bored, I was blogging back, you know, like 2015 I started, I was like looking at everything. There's a, there's a, you know, Genetics of pain tolerance, Genetics of Exercise Enjoyment, Genetics of muscle damage recovery. There's, there's obviously look at, I remember I wrote this article for teenage back in the day and there was some fascinating studies back then. They took the top responders versus the, the non-responders and they compared their physiology. And this is again, this is like 15-year-old research, maybe 20-year-old research. But it was like the top responders had better satellite cell efficiency. Meaning the satellite cells are like stem cells that lay, they lay quiescent unless they're called upon through stimulating gains.

2 (1h 24m 27s):
You know, you, you mechanical tension or whatever, some evidence that metabolic stress and muscle damage can, can signal them. But like they, they're called upon when you hit a hard workout. And then what they end up doing is the satellite cells, they have nuclei in them and they fuse, they fuse and there's steps to it. I can't remember the exact steps, but they fuse to the muscle cell and they lend their nuclei amazing because mul muscles are multinucleated. They don't just have one nuclei, they have multiple nuclei. And there's this, my nuclear domain theory that your muscle size is limited by the number of nuclei in it. So the, the top responders say you start out with 50, a muscle cell has, we'll just say 20 nuclei and 20 satellite cells.

2 (1h 25m 12s):
I'm gonna butcher the hell outta this. But anyway, after training for 12 weeks, I think the study looked at training arms two or three times a week. And some people like newbies trained arms like two, three times a week and didn't even gain arm size. Like these are people that you look at them and you're like, they don't even lift or they don't know what they're doing. They just might have really poor Genetics for growth. And the, but the best responders, like, you know, I remember one of 'em like doubled their strength and like dramatically increase their size by like maybe like 2030 or maybe more. I can't remember the like percent increase in muscle size. So the non-responders start out with 20 nuclei in the muscles and 20 satellite cells and they end with 2020.

2 (1h 25m 58s):
The top responders would end with 30 30, meaning now they have 10 more nuclei, but they also somehow have 10, like the satellite cells replenish amazing, they have 10 more satellite cells. And that seems to be a big difference. There are also like mechano growth factors, a splice variant of IGF one I think. And there's like myogenic growth factors that have different names like MyoD, they, they have different, it's not, people think testosterone is so important and growth hormone and all this stuff, but it's, there's so many things that are important. There's so many pathways, so many, if you study muscle physiology, I don't, I just send him off, send these studies to my friend Brad Schofield and hope he reads them because I don't understand all the, all the pathways.

2 (1h 26m 44s):
There's so many of them. They, they tend to have acronyms, you know, at the, the JNK pathway, the red pathway, the fox f you know, these, these pathways that only the muscle scientist, but we don't know, we don't have a grip on this. But there, there's Genetics to every aspect of it. There's Genetics to your anatomy, your muscle bellies, how you're gonna look, there's Genetics to how you're gonna respond. There's Genetics of everything. And so what you've tapped into is how you can keep the goal, the goal, keep lifting weights to where you enjoy it and don't make it something that feels like a chore or something you dread. And that doesn't get talked about enough in this whole concept of long-term Hypertrophy, long-term gains has a lot to do with remaining injury.

2 (1h 27m 28s):
Not having these crushing injuries, not being in pain all the time. And that, we talked about this yesterday, I've never heard anyone discuss this, but I think it affects your knee, your non-exercise activity thermogenesis where you don't move around as much if

0 (1h 27m 41s):
You're injured,

2 (1h 27m 42s):
If you have nagging pain. My knees hurt right now. I can't do squats right now. I love, I love training quads hard, but I can, or

0 (1h 27m 49s):
Just run up the stairs. Yeah,

2 (1h 27m 50s):
Run up. Yeah. Like right now I have some knee pain right now as I'm sitting here. So if I think of standing up, I'm like, eh, maybe I'll just chill here. I'm not gonna get up. If you have low back pain, you don't wanna pick something up off the ground.

0 (1h 28m 4s):
Well this matches the data that was published in science I think about a year or so ago, which was shocking to the world that our metabolism doesn't really change much over, over our lifespan. What happens is people move around a lot less, less neat non-exercise induced or agenesis. And I totally agree and I'd not heard this idea before until yesterday when you said that when we have a nagging pain or injury, we just move a lot less. And when we move a lot less, we bring less calories. And then there's a feedback where we tend to feel more lethargic when we move less as opposed to more. One of the perhaps most valuable things that I've ever learned in my work life, my workout life and, and just life. I try and apply this everywhere and I haven't always been successful in doing this.

0 (1h 28m 46s):
When I was a graduate student at Berkeley, there was a professor there, his name is Bob Knight, he's a neurologist. So he's a clinician and a, and a very good one and also a researcher. And I remember asking him at the beginning of graduate school, I don't know why I had the nerve to do this, but I caught him outside of the building and I said, you know, like what's a piece of advice? Like what's to being really good at this whole research science thing in addition to reading papers and learning the field and collecting data and you know, and you know, I was driven obviously, but I want to know how he was able to do as many things as he did be a clinician, run a lab. And he seemed like, like a pretty chill guy. Which it turns out he was, and I'll never forget what he said.

0 (1h 29m 28s):
He said, figure out what you can do consistently each week and don't do anymore except under conditions of emergency. Like a deadline or you know, just figure it out. He said for him it was something like eight to nine hours a day of real work. This was before smartphones when you would actually go in and work. You didn't have to compete with phone. Yeah, phone for attention. And he said for him it was also on the weekends, he said that he liked, I'll never forget, he said he liked mindless recreation that was not destructive. So like not drinking a lot, not partying a lot, not staying out too late.

0 (1h 30m 10s):
But for him it was fishing, hanging out with his family and I think he was into exercising as well. So I was like, oh, that's pretty clever. So I, I figured out, you know, how much I could work per day across each week and still continue to do that output. But he said something else that was really key that maybe we can kind of transport onto the exercise piece. 'cause you can probably sense where this is going is he said, and every five years update that number. And I was like, really? He is like, yeah, every five years he said, you know, you're in your twenties now. Back then I was in my twenties. He said the, you could probably work 15 hours a day, which I probably did.

0 (1h 30m 50s):
I probably, at that time I was a little maniacal. I probably worked 15 hours a day, five or six days a week in graduate school. That number actually went up. But then I noticed I started getting sick a bit in when I was a postdoc, so I had to throttle back, right? And so he, I wonder if we could kind of transport that onto the exercise thing, which is, 'cause we've got people listening now that are probably in their teens, twenties, thirties, forties, fifties, 60 men and women, different goals. Sort of like, what can I do every week for the next five years, assuming you don't get injured. No major life crisis. I feel like that's kind of the way I, I approach this. And it turns out for me it's just been three days a week of resistance training, two or three days a week of cardio, one full day off.

0 (1h 31m 31s):
And likewise with my work, I I, you know, I adjust every five years or so. And I'm wondering what your thoughts on, I take no credit for this, this is all Bob Knight, MD PhD who, who, but I thought, wow, like this simple thing is such a gem for me because back then I thought I just need to work as much as possible. But he understood, eventually you'll hit a wall. You need to update these schedules.

2 (1h 31m 53s):
So I think there's so much truth to this and not just with working out, but like even nowadays, if you're an entrepreneur on Social Media, you feel guilty the rest of your life. 'cause you could always be doing more, but it's like, what's sustainable? You could work now, we can work. I mean, especially you, how many comments you must get, how many dms you must get, how many emails, how many opportunities there are. Like I realize for me with my career, I'm like, if I lift weights, if I train clients for a few hours, if I read research at night for a couple hours and make a Social Media post that's that's a busy day, you know, and, and respond to the comments and stuff that I did good.

2 (1h 32m 38s):
And we need to pat ourselves on the back. That's hard to sustain day in, day out, week in, week out, week, week out. Because you can take on too much and then you, you fizzle you what's realistic, what's realistic. And I've had to learn, quit taking on too much, quit and quit feeling guilty that that's what you, you do this consistently. You have something sustainable.

Function Health (1h 32m 59s):
I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our Sponsors function. Last year I became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing function. Provides over 100 advanced lab tests that give you a key snapshot of your entire bodily health. This snapshot offers you with insights on your heart health, hormone health, immune functioning, nutrient levels, and much more. They've also recently added tests for toxins such as BPA exposure from harmful plastics and tests for pfas or forever chemicals function. Not only provides testing of over a hundred biomarkers key to your physical and mental health, but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from top doctors who are expert in the relevant areas. For example, in one of my first tests with function, I learned that I had elevated levels of mercury in my blood function. Not only helped me detect that, but offered insights into how best to reduce my mercury levels, which included limiting my tuna consumption. I've been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine, both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification. And I should say by taking a second function test that approach worked. Comprehensive blood testing is vitally important. There's so many things related to your mental and physical health that can only be detected in a blood test. The problem is blood testing has always been very expensive and complicated. In contrast, I've been super impressed by function, simplicity and at the level of cost it is very affordable. As a consequence, I decided to join their scientific advisory board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast. If you'd like to try function, you can go to Function Health dot com slash huberman. Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people, but they're offering early access to huberman podcast listeners. Again, that's Function Health dot com slash huberman to get early access to function.

Along those lines, let's talk about glutes. When I was growing up, glutes weren't like a thing. I mean people still had 'em, but it wasn't a thing that was emphasized in the media. There weren't songs about them. It wasn't something that people selectively trained for. Nowadays you hear glutes of the new biceps, et cetera, setting aside different preferences about glutes, moderate glutes or no glutes. Everybody has glutes. Could you describe for us what are the major functions of the Glute and why it's useful to build strength and in some cases Hypertrophy for the glutes, for men and for women,

2 (1h 35m 34s):
The glutes do three main things. Hip extension, hip abduction, hip, external rotation. They also do posterior pelvic tilt, which is like hip extension, but I'll explain all, all three roles. If you are sprinting, your leg is out in front of you, you power it down, you know your foot touches down and you accelerate forward. That's hip extension, front to back. The thigh is up, it's moving downwards. Most people are aware of hip extension. It also does hip external rotation, which means think of a baseball player, you know about ready to swing a bat. They're gonna rotate and the hip rotates laterally so you, it twists the body laterally.

2 (1h 36m 18s):
And then abduction is simply raising your leg out to the side like you're doing a jumping jack. When you're bent over though, you can also do hip abduction. That's like doing the seated hip abduction machine.

0 (1h 36m 31s):
I think most people are probably not familiar with abduction and abduction. Could you explain abduction and abduction? I'm thinking about the exercise in the gym where people are seated. It looks like kinda like a recliner chair or a, or a standard chair. And then there are these pads that either are the outside of the knees or on the insides of the knees. And you're either squeezing in against resistance or you're pushing out against resistance. Yep.

2 (1h 36m 55s):
So the squeezing in, you're abducting, those are your inner thigh muscles. And you can think of abduction as adding to the body or whereas abducting, you think of the word taking away from the body. That's where you spread your legs outwards against resistance. So the, when you're upright or leaning forward, then you involve the gluteus maximus more and a little bit less of the gluteus media. So it might be the posterior fibers, the gluteus medias, not to get too complicated, but, but that basically the glutes do. The gluteus maximus mainly I would say does, you know, hip extens is by far the most popular.

2 (1h 37m 35s):
And then hip, ex hip, hip external rotation is more in sports. We don't have a lot of exercise that that involve hip external rotation. There's a couple of good ones, but they're not very common. And then hip abduction, especially transverse plane, hip abduction or the horizontal plane, hip abduction, like the seated hip abduction machine is effective too. So it's a very versatile muscle. You don't even have to focus on pelvic tilt. That's a more advanced concept. Same with like transverse plain hip abduction. Mainly if you just know that the glutes pull the leg backwards as in sprinting, or if you're in a deep squatter lunge and you stand standup, that's hip extension.

2 (1h 38m 15s):
It also raises the leg out to the side and also rotates the body outward, not inward outward. And those are the roles of the glutes. And then how you create a proper program. Design is an interesting topic because most people in the past, they've only focused on hip extension. In the past it was always just squat or deadlift, squat or deadlift or lunge back in when in our era it was squat, deadlift, lunge, that's all people did. Those are vertical hip extension exercises and they're very, very effective. The thing is, they also grow the legs very well. So if you're a male and you want to grow the legs, yes, have at it.

2 (1h 38m 56s):
What if you're a woman that doesn't want a lot of leg growth or you're just trying to maximize your recoverable volume? I've noticed a very important phenomenon happen over throughout my career, being the glute guy in the nineties, you remember it in the, in the nineties it was people just did squats, lunges, deadlifts. That's how you developed your glutes. And then I come along and I, earlier I mentioned these strength coaches that were doing Glute activation and the Glute activation wasn't squats, deadlift lunges. We were doing Glute bridges on the ground. We were doing fire hydrants, we were throwing bands around doing lateral band walks.

2 (1h 39m 37s):
What we were doing was using the glutes from different vectors. So instead of just going up and down in the sagittal plane, you know, like what we've always done, we were doing lateral and rotational stuff and also working the glutes from front to back. So I started this new terminology 'cause we always had the planar terminology, which was sagal plane, frontal plane, transverse plane. And I said, think of vectors instead. You have axial loading, which is your vertical squats, deadlifts, lunges, step ups, split squats, good mornings, et cetera. Then you have your anter posterior loading that's front to back.

2 (1h 40m 17s):
If you're doing a back extension, you know, a, a horizontal back extension. If you're doing a Glute bridge, you're loaded from the front, pushing forward again, like pushing front to back on the body. So that's inter posterior vector. And then you have your lateral vector left to right, and then you have your rotational vector, which is rotational force. I created this what I call Rule of Thirds, and I just said, this is a way to maximize your recoverable volume. A third of your exercise selection should be vertical in nature. Those are the hardest to recover from. They also build your legs. They're probably the most efficient exercise because they work so much muscle mass.

2 (1h 40m 57s):
These are your variations of squats, dead Lifts, lunges, split squats, step up, good mornings. Then you have your horizontal movements. These don't beat you up as much. They don't work you as much in the stretch position. They work you in a squeeze position. These are your variations of Hip Thrust, Glute bridges, back extensions, reverse hypers, 45 degree hypers and to an extent cable kickbacks. They don't beat you up as much. And then the remaining third, it can be lateral rotary. These don't beat you up at all. They're your hip abduction movements. Your ca from a, you know, cable column putting the, the, the ankle strap on or using ankle weights or putting a band on or, but these are your basically all we, what we did yesterday, that Glute medias exercise at the end.

2 (1h 41m 45s):
They're lateral, they build the Glute medias and, and mimus and also the upper subdivision of the Glute max. But they don't beat you up that much. They're not so hard to recover from. So that's where I said you can do, you know with my, that movement pattern checklist we said earlier where you pick one squat lunge, one hinge pull, one thrust bridge, and one abduction movement, you could do three sets of each of those. That's 12 sets. You do that three times a week that's 36 sets per week. People would say that's overkill. But I was learning from the strength coaches back then and we were doing similar workouts to that three times a week. All the popular strength coaches, they would do a, a knee dominant movement and a hip dominant movement, meaning a squat, lunge variation, and then a hinge variation.

2 (1h 42m 32s):
And they, people could recover from it. Well you, I knew that the athletes could re could do that three times a week. They're recovering. I'm like, if the athletes can recover from it, then if you add in a thrust bridge movement and an and an abduction movement, it's not gonna be too much more. Especially 'cause we were doing abduction and, and bridging movements in the warmup. So kind of how I became popular, I invented the Hip Thrust. I remember just going, these movements are awesome. Why don't we load them up? Why don't make we make 'em harder? Why are we doing 'em as Glute activation in the warmup? Why don't we do 'em as a resistance exercise? I'm like, these guys are brilliant. They're, they're abusing bands and body weight stuff, but why are we doing wimpy movements?

2 (1h 43m 13s):
Why don't we push the envelope on these? 'cause I don't like doing high reps. You don't either. We hate high reps, I wanna do low reps. I don't wanna do 20 reps. It's something, how can I load up that bridge pattern? How, and that's how I came up with Hip Thrust. And then I'm like, how can I load up some of these abduction movements? And I came up with more movements to load up abduction. So then I said, the Rule of Thirds, a third of your movements should be lateral rotary, a third horizontal, a third vertical. You can recover from it. But you're also, people will say that's 36 sets for the Glute max. No, 12 of those sets are more for the Glute medias and minis, which are different muscles. They're different muscles than the Glute max. So it's really 24 sets for the Glute max.

2 (1h 43m 55s):
There's some overlap there. But the point is, I've learned that people can recover from this system and I learned a lot, I have to credit these strength coaches back in the day for helping me come up with those ideas. And I transitioned that into the bodybuilding world where people attacked me and said, there's no way you can recover from it. And I'm going, trust me, they can recover. But the women listen because they're like, I want, I wanna train my glutes. I wanna build my glutes more so than, you know, these, these men are telling me train five days a week, train upper body four days and legs. Once I want to train, I wanna listen to this guy and train. It makes sense.

2 (1h 44m 35s):
'cause I would always say back then someone said, you need to put, you know, an an inch around your glutes in the next month. You know, or you can, you can win the, your I'll pay a million dollars to put an inch around your glutes in two months or whatever. Are you gonna train glutes once a week? No, you're gonna train them three times a week. Same with the arms.

0 (1h 44m 55s):
Or at least, or at least twice a week.

2 (1h 44m 56s):
Yeah. If I said, Andrew, I'll give you a a million dollars if you put an inch around your arms in the next two months, you're gonna train them once a week. No, you'll probably train them every other day and you'll work, you'll realize the sweet spot where you can still recover from it. So the people listening and what really what they listened to was they saw my before and after transformations back

0 (1h 45m 17s):
Then. Yeah, the before and afters on your Social Media are super impressive. I mean clearly people get incredible results. I, I wanna make sure I ask a few questions that I'm guessing are on people's minds now that everyone's thinking about glutes. Let's say a woman or man comes to you and says, Hey, I want more lower Glute max, the area where the glutes meet the hamstring. What is the movement that you prescribe? Let's make it extreme. Let's say they were only going to do one or two movements for their glutes and that's where they wanted more growth. What movements would you give them?

2 (1h 45m 51s):
I think the reverse lunge is the best for the lower Glute max. But it's almost too good. So if you're gonna train it three times a week, I would say don't do reverse, it's too good.

0 (1h 46m 1s):
Okay. So once or twice a

2 (1h 46m 2s):
Week. So yeah, so if you're just gonna train glutes once a week, reverse lunge is your go-to movement. We, we don't have a lot of research. I wish you, you do a deficit. Should you do smith machine, should you do dumbbell? But they're all gonna be effective. Deficit means stand on a box to get a little more range of motion. But I like step ups 'cause they don't tend to get you as sore. So if you're training three times a week, you could do step up all three, three

0 (1h 46m 29s):
Times. So down and stepping up onto a box.

2 (1h 46m 31s):
But we used to do high step ups, we are more upright foot is up higher. That's gonna work more quads. I think the most Glute dominant way to step up is to lean and just go to a thigh parallel position. Meaning the thigh is parallel to the ground so you reach back. I think that's the most Glute dominant way to do

0 (1h 46m 52s):
'em. Just stepping back off the box so that, that's the thigh that's still up on the on the box is is parallel to the floor.

2 (1h 46m 59s):
Yep. And you, you lean, you reach back, tap the control it all the way down, tap the foot down, then come up. But, but you also have to like remember if you train glutes Monday, Wednesday, Friday, if you do train glutes three times a week, you have an extra day for recovery on the Friday. So that's where I could say do two sets of reverse lunges or walking lunges on the Friday. 'cause you have an extra day to recover. A lot of times when I'm training my clients they'll go Coach, what else should I do? Nothing. You're done. You did good. You gotta train in two days. It's a different art to training glutes three times a week. I mean think if you had to train pecks three times a week or biceps three times a week, you wouldn't do these marathon workouts.

2 (1h 47m 43s):
You'd know I gotta have a good session in two days. I can't do too much. The this system works well but it can be overdone. It needs to be individualized and tinkered with so that you can keep coming back and being recovered for the lower Glute max. I'd say best movement is probably reverse lung but it can be too good. It can make you too. So sometimes it makes people's adductors at Magnus sore and then two days later you have a crummy workout. If that's the case, don't do reversal lunges do step up instead. Squats and R DLS and leg press fit in single leg leg press especially Glute dominant with your foot higher up on the platform. Work good for that category as well. For the upper gluteus maximus, we need more research because I've thought probably Hip Thrust are probably the best for that according to EMG electromyography.

2 (1h 48m 31s):
But EMG doesn't perfectly predict growth. What I like about Hip Thrust is each, you can do a lot more volume. Lately I've been just prioritizing Hip Thrust. I do nine sets every third day and I think that's overkill. But I do, I do different types like and I can recover from it. I don't even get sore from it. It's crazy. You can do so much volume but, but Hip Thrust, I think theoretically people feel it more in the upper Glute max. But again, we don't have evidence of this as, can you really different get differential growth? I would say for sure the seated hip abduction leaning forward though I don't think that's gonna grow. Or at least like upright. If you're perfectly upright at a 90 degree hip angle doing seated hip abduction, I think that would target mostly upper gluteus maximus without a lot of lower based on analyzing the fiber directions.

2 (1h 49m 22s):
But that's just theoretical.

0 (1h 49m 24s):
Okay, couple of practical questions. What is the most common mistake that you see people making when they do Hip Thrust on the Hip Thrust machine or using a Barbell, you know, over over their pelvis in the gym? I'm not talking about your clients. Yeah, I'm talking about when you go into a gym. 'cause I go into a gym, you'll see typically it's women doing Hip Thrust. Yep. Sometimes men, but most often it's women on a Hip Thrust machine or a Barbell loaded up with the pad or the towel wrapped around the Barbell and they're doing Hip Thrust. What's the most common mistake that you see and what is the solution to that mistake?

2 (1h 50m 3s):
And this might not even be a mistake, this might be an advantage we don't know yet because we haven't looked into range of motion on Hip Thrust. What we always said the first decade was people are loading up too heavy and you're not reaching full hip extension.

0 (1h 50m 17s):
So you're not getting into that sort of reverse table pose. I think of it as like a, in gymnastics, I think they called a crab pose where you put your hands behind you, your feet are flat in the ground and you make right angles with your knees and you make your shoulder extension like

2 (1h 50m 30s):
A tabletop. Yeah,

0 (1h 50m 31s):
Like you could walk like a tabletop, like reverse tabletop. Yeah. That's essentially what the Hip Thrust is except you know you're not going to have your arms back that way

2 (1h 50m 38s):
They're not reaching full hip extension. Okay. And the hip can go into hip hyperextension with bent knees. Average is probably around 10 degrees with straight legs. You can get a little more hip hyperextension, you can get about 20 degrees. But there's a genetic com, like an anatomy component to that. Some people can get 40 degrees, some people can get zero. They can't, they have trouble just reaching neutral. But you, you can go higher than like straight. A lot of times you can kind of almost be

0 (1h 51m 9s):
Bowed,

2 (1h 51m 9s):
Bowed up. But it's, it's important to make sure that hyperextension comes from the hip, not the lumbar spine. So anyway, just think of it like this. You do vertical movements to work the stretch position with the glutes. These place the most torque, the most loading on the hip when you're deep down in the stretch,

0 (1h 51m 30s):
Vertical movements like the squat,

2 (1h 51m 31s):
The squat, the lunge, they really load up the stretch position. So when you do Hip Thrust, don't try to make it a stretch position movement because you have better movements for working the stretch. I do think full range Hip Thrust are best for Glute growth compared to just doing partials. But make sure you're coming up all the way and reaching full hip extension. Maybe on, if you do a set of 10, maybe your last two reps don't quite reach full hip extension, but it shouldn't be like where you're only getting a third of the whip.

0 (1h 51m 59s):
So really hump the ceiling really

2 (1h 52m 1s):
Squeezing at the top.

0 (1h 52m 3s):
I want to make sure that we return to one specific thing before I move on to questions about stubborn body parts in general and how to overcome stubborn body parts. But the two, the two relate. So let's say somebody wants to improve their Glute development. They just want maybe bigger glutes or more rounded glutes or more shaped glutes. It's funny, whenever we say bigger, when it comes to muscles, oftentimes like the, the men typically are like, yeah, bigger. And the women are like, well I more want shape. But of course tone is something related to leanness combined with a bit of muscle density et cetera. There's a bunch of stuff there. But,

2 (1h 52m 40s):
Well let's just say women want mu bigger muscles. It's hard for them to know that, to know that they want bigger glutes, they want want be bigger over, they don't, women don't want a giant Glute, but what they're saying is, I want rounder glutes. So a round rounder glutes that you, when you're, when you're, you look at the Glute muscle, if it's, there's not a lot of bulge to it, it's flat, it's yeah atrophy, there's, that has a Hypertrophy. To get that round shape, you need bigger Glute muscles, you need Hypertrophy, they need Hypertrophy. Specific training for the gluteus maximus. And let's face it, most people don't have really good Glute Genetics. Most people, their only, well, especially a lot of women who desire big glutes, their only chance at getting big round muscular glutes, like, well not big, even just round glutes that they want is to do really optimal Glute training and have the diet that matches it.

2 (1h 53m 31s):
So they need to know that, they need to know that this advertising campaigns with like Pilates and you know, bar and all these classes that, that they say, well these will give you long lean muscles. These are get a lot of the female specific marketing pres upon women's fears of getting too bulky, too muscular. But for the glutes, it's how are you gonna grow the glutes if you don't get strong? How are you gonna grow the glutes if you're just doing wimpy movements holding for or like stretches, it can't happen. So they do need to know what you're, what you're seeking is not Glute tone, it's Glute Hypertrophy.

0 (1h 54m 7s):
Yeah, an excellent point. And I think that, and we can't speak for all women or all men certainly, but what seems to be the theme is that people want Hypertrophy of specific muscles. They would like to replace what is currently adipose tissue fat with muscle and have more quote unquote shape to a given body region. Right? But in the end, as, as you point out, this means more Hypertrophy, more growth of those given muscles and then the amount of adipose tissue is handled by the calories in calor calories out formula. Plus a couple of other little details there that do matter but are far less important than calories in, calories out.

0 (1h 54m 47s):
So if somebody wants to grow their glutes, you've recommended the three types of movements that will do that. Well, a vertical movement, some squat, hip hinge, r dls lunges, reverse lunges, step ups, these kinds of things Hip Thrust seem, which you invented. You know, I didn't know that until recently, but that's awesome. That Hip Thrust and then some something for the inner thigh. The the and the out and the outer thigh, right? Yeah. You're not, you, I don't know if you're treating inner thigh and outer thigh both as as relevant to the glutes, but something where you're, where you're pushing your knees outward against resistance on the outside of the knees.

0 (1h 55m 30s):
Abduction, ab abduction. So

2 (1h 55m 32s):
By the way, the inner thigh gets worked a lot when you do the vertical movements, the hip extension exercises like squats, lunges, some people don't want that. So that's where you gotta get, because

0 (1h 55m 44s):
It makes the leg bigger. Yes.

2 (1h 55m 45s):
Yeah. So that's something to talk about is what if you want to grow your glutes without growing the legs?

0 (1h 55m 51s):
Okay, let's, let's definitely talk about that in the meantime, what I'm hearing is the person that wants to grow their glutes should be doing those three types of exercises. Typically those three types of exercises at least twice a week and perhaps three times a week. With the understanding that the third session in that week may have to be at slightly less intensity that Friday session before the weekend, if you really beat up the glutes on your previous two Glute days. But training your glutes twice a week might be sufficient.

2 (1h 56m 25s):
And I mean there's not much evidence that three times a week is better than two times a week in the literature. But two times a week is safer. It's your safer bet because you're gonna be recovered three times a week. It's more problematic, my opinion. You can get away with it. But for a lot of men, if you come to me and you're a man and you say, Hey, I want more Glute growth, I'm not gonna tell you to do booty by Brett. My booty by Brett program is like squat, lunge movement, hinge movement, you know, thrust bridge, movement, abduction. And then we do one upper body press and one upper body pull. And you get really strong at those upper body movements. 'cause I'm always having to do chin-ups and pushups and bench press and military press. It works well. But men have different goals. We also want to grow the biceps, the delts, the packs, the lats.

2 (1h 57m 8s):
So you don't tell 'em to do glutes, train glutes three times a week. You just say, look, what are you doing for legs? Are you, are you, some guys will, like you got the typical guy who skips legs who says like, oh I just run on the treadmill for legs. That guy needs to start training his legs. Also, you have the guys that are like, I just do leg press, leg extension, like curls. Okay, you should probably do more glutes. But if you have a normal, if the guy already does squats and deadlifts, great. Add in Hip Thrust because they're not gonna compromise your recovery. Just add in Hip Thrust. And if you feel okay doing seated hip abduction, throw that in too. More men are doing seated hip abduction and more men are doing Hip Thrust with the advent of all these plate loaded machines.

2 (1h 57m 50s):
You see now in gyms, they're making it way more convenient to Hip Thrust 'cause people don't wanna set it up the setup back the first like decade, we all always, you had to set up these, the o my OG followers will laugh at the times where we had to drag plates and barbells and aerobic steps and risers and benches all across the gym. And now you just buckle in. Now you buckle in. It's so much more convenient. But just add in Hip Thrust or 45 degree hypers Glute dominant fashion. So you're already doing the stretch position work. If hopefully the man is already for his quads, he's already doing squats or, or like lunges or split squats or deep leg press, he's already doing that. If he's already doing stiff leg dos or R dls, great. Just add in a squeeze position work.

2 (1h 58m 31s):
'cause it's not gonna t it's not gonna, you're gonna be recovered. And I think there's some synergy to it. It's weird 'cause like if you've only trained, we saw this with you yesterday. You have, you have big glutes, but you don't train the extended range, the the squeeze position. So you're very weak compared to how strong you are in the flex position. You're, you're, you belt squat a ton of weight. You can, you're strong in the flex position but not the squeeze position. When you start getting that squeeze position strong, good things tend to happen across the body. So it's not just for, it's for function too. And I've seen, I've heard just so many stories over the years of people going, man, when I start hip thrusting my lower body mechanics change, my function change.

2 (1h 59m 15s):
I no longer get this type of pain. I know I, I feel myself being more functional. So you do it for a function too. But I think it really adds to the Glute growth because every man is sold with isolation movements or single joint movements. And it's weird because I've noticed men kind of getting salty of this Glute phenomenon, this Glute training phenomenon. So if, you know, I, I've never heard, like say you were doing, you posted a video of yourself doing curls on your Instagram, you're not gonna get a bunch of men that go, bro just do chin-ups, LOL bro, just do pull supinated pull downs. You're wasting your time with that.

0 (1h 59m 53s):
Yeah. There's this sort of understanding that compound and isolation movements are important.

2 (1h 59m 57s):
We, we all know that if you're trying to maximize your arm size, yes you can get big arms. If you have a really strong bench, press dips shoulder press, you know, pull chin up, pull down in rows. You're gonna have big arms, but they're gonna get bigger. If you add in some dedicated elbow flexion and extension work, you're, you everyone knows that. And every and all the women know that with glutes too. It's the men that tend, tend to have a problem. They, they like the old days, like in my day we did this. And they want to say, just quit wasting your time with those silly Hip Thrust. Or there's those kickbacks so that abduction just do squats and deadlifts and lunges. I will tell you the listeners, the, you know, the listeners who train glutes know this, A lot of people don't end up with big glutes when they focus on squats and deadlifts.

2 (2h 0m 44s):
You can go to powerlifting competitions. These are people who make a their, their main hobbyists squatting and deadlifting and they're in their singlets. You can't hide it. You go to local powerlifting competition, you will see

0 (2h 0m 54s):
Singlets are like the wrestling,

2 (2h 0m 56s):
You know, uniform type thing. Yeah. They, in powerlifting you'd think you'd see good Glute development. You see you're like how are these people squatting and deadlifting all the time when they don't have glutes? My clients have better Glute development than what you see at powerlifting competitions. It's 'cause they're using the Rule of Thirds. They're training the glutes through different vectors that can be a distraction if you get too carried away and wanna do every Glute exercise. 'cause sometimes it's like no, just get stronger at the basics. And then sometimes it's no incorporate more variety. But I will say if men want to grow their glutes, so if you're a male listener right now and you say, I would like to have more Glute development. I'm already doing, you know, a type of squat or lunge. I'm already doing a a type of like hinge, like an RDL. Just add in two sets of Hip Thrust twice a week.

2 (2h 1m 37s):
And if you wanna throw in the seated hip production machine, do that too. You'll notice some good Glute growth over time. And especially get strong at the Hip Thrust. Start out like start out light, master that mind muscle connection, make sure you're using the full range and then gain strength over time. Get to where you can do three 15 for 20 reps. If you don't like high reps to 4 0 5 for 10 reps, trust me, you will notice some improvements with, if you control the weight through the full range of motion. That's very simple actionable advice. Where,

0 (2h 2m 7s):
Where is the bar for, let's assume someone doesn't have access to a hip thruster machine and they're using the Barbell placed over the, the pelvis.

2 (2h 2m 16s):
So the bar for some people you just keep the bar right above the pubic bone and you, it stays right there throughout the whole range of motion. Probably like, probably 66% of people can do it that way. If you have a type of Hip Anatomy where your, like your pelvis is off to the side where the, where when the bar is right above your pubic bone, it's gonna be hitting your, your, you know, your pelvic bones, then it's excruciatingly painful for those people. They push it forward as they come up. Got it. So what happens is probably one third of my clients, as they rise up, they push the bar up until they're on, but then it even their upper thighs.

0 (2h 2m 58s):
Oh, onto their upper thighs. Yeah.

2 (2h 3m 0s):
Ooh. That's the what, what my women do. The men tend to keep it above the pubic bone. We have different pelvic anatomy and so I can get people to do it comfortably. It it takes time though. Everyone can do, every client I've had can do Hip Thrust. You learn to keep the bar right there in place. It stays put, it's scary to look at it. You might think it looks dangerous or hard to pull off. Also no one starts with 4 0 5. You start off with body weight, you start over the Barbell lightweight and you, you build up the tolerance to that pain over time. It's the same as when you start doing like low bar squats or high bar squats. It's, it's like, ah, this hurts. And then you, or if you have ever done exert your things, ah, this hurts or front squats, this hurts.

2 (2h 3m 45s):
Like hell hook grip, ah, this hurts like hell. And then th three weeks later, four weeks later, you're fine. Okay, great to know. So the to know the bar placement though does need to change depending on your Hip Anatomy. But those are the two main things people do. But when you, there's a difference with how, what I recommend for men and women to build their glutes and with men. If you, if you're worried about Hip Thrust, learn how to do Glute dominant 45 degree hypers, that's an awesome Glute exercise. It's hip extension, we call it the back extension. It's hip extension and if you round the back flare your feet out a little bit, when you round the back, you're shutting the erectors off and then you're using your glutes to pull you up.

2 (2h 4m 25s):
Hmm. It's an awesome hip extension exercise. It's, it's a, it's, so add that in or Hip Thrust and then if you're comfortable doing seated hip direction, you're gonna see results just from that alone. You don't have to Right. Pay attention to all this stuff we've talked about in this podcast. Just do a simple thing of adding in Hip Thrust or you can do Glute bridges off the smith machine. Those are kind of easy to set a bench down and Glute bridges or Hip Thrust, we'll

0 (2h 4m 52s):
Put a link to, I saw a clip that you've posted that or made it really clear how the Smith machine can be useful, especially get angles that might be more difficult to get with the classic hip thruster

2 (2h 5m 2s):
Approach. Yeah. And then, and in 45 Hyers, add one of those in twice a week. It to your leg day. If you train legs once a week, start training legs twice a week and you know, do a, do a compound movement or a multi-joint movement for the, the, the quads, the hamstrings and the glutes. And you'll be, you'll, you'll be able to recover just fine. And that will help you grow your glutes but also use train the glutes from different vectors. I'm telling you, I can say this with so much confidence when you start doing Hip Thrust correctly and really feeling that squeeze if you've never done it before, good things start happening in the body. It's just, we should be strong at n range hip extension. And it, if you look at the glutes on anatomy chart, it's kinda the keystone.

2 (2h 5m 44s):
It's like the keystone muscles that tie everything together. A lot of good things happen when you do that. And then just resist. You said, what are the main errors? What are the common flaws with hip thrusting? I kind of got sidetracked, but it's not coming up all the way. Or like people's knee angle. If your feet are too far out, you feel it more in your hamstring. Your feet, feet are too close. You feel it in the stretch, in the rectus s you don't feel as much in the glutes and just ego lifting. In fact, I kind of think it's this tightrope we walk where you gotta push it hard and then all of a sudden you realize, you watch a video if you record yourself or something, you're like, eh, I, yeah, I was progressively overloading and now I now my form looks ugly, I gotta dial it back.

2 (2h 6m 30s):
And that's a common thing we have to do with a lot of exercise. I, I realize I, I was a little too greedy with my Progressive Overload and my, my form is compromised. My range of motion has been compromised. I'm a little sloppier I'm gonna reset and that you have to do that from time to time.

0 (2h 6m 46s):
Excellent. Thank you. Those, those are very helpful tips. And I'll just add that the Glute medias exercise standing close

2 (2h 6m 54s):
To a wall. I close Glute medias Hip Thrust, Glute media. It could be called like a plate standing abduction, but the 'cause you eventually use a plate but it works the grounded the Glute medias of the grounded leg, not the top, not the up leg. It works the down leg, that meter,

0 (2h 7m 8s):
We'll put a link to that specific timestamp where you ex showed me the movement requires no equipment. I will say that adding those in, even though I now realize I wasn't doing them exactly right, but adding those in a few years ago on the suggestion of Jeff Cavalier from Lene X resolved what I thought was a back pain issue, completely. An ongoing nagging back issue that would leave me feeling completely debilitated, folded over often from sitting too much or even from certain mistakes made in training and getting Glute media stronger resolved that, and what you just described yesterday and, and took me through was incredible because I could really feel the activation and I can really sense how it stabilizes the pelvis and does all the great things that people can look up that Glute medias does.

0 (2h 7m 57s):
So thank you for that. Although we're mainly talking about the glutes, you've also been giving us a beautiful description of how to prioritize a, a lagging muscle group. It just so happens that the glutes are lagging for most people. Let's transfer that to essentially any muscle group with the understanding that different muscle groups have different needs, right? Different size muscle groups recover more or less. It can handle different volumes. We certainly don't have time to get into all the details of that and it's highly individual as well. But what I'm taking away from what you've said so far is that if one does a really honest assessment of their development, their aesthetic development, their strength development, there almost always is one or two body parts that are lagging that need help that aesthetically or functionally or strength wise or all of the above are behind the rest of the body.

0 (2h 8m 55s):
I think men more than women in my observation, tend to focus a lot on their stronger Lifts in the gym. Like, oh, if they can bench a lot and they've got really, you know, a lot of chest development, they'll like bench a lot. I always wanna pull 'em aside but like listen, like lay off the benches. You see these guys with like heavy lower pec development, no upper pec development or just like huge chest and then like pipe arms and no forms and you just kinda wanna be like, listen man. Like is it really that necessary to like lean into your strengths that much could, you know, I think many people, men and women could afford to do an assessment of like where they could prioritize. So can we just transmit what you've already said so far and just say, listen, if I wanna bring up my shoulders for instance, maybe I train them two or th three times a week.

0 (2h 9m 44s):
Currently I'm training them once a week but really twice because I train my shoulders on shoulder, I have a shoulder and back day it's actually a push, push pull upper body day minus arms. And then on arms day I'm doing some reverse bench dips. I tend to do rear dealt flies again. I do some things that I do dips. So I'm basically hitting shoulders twice a week. But let's say I wanted to bring up my shoulder development or another muscle group. Would you suggest adding another day, like a third day and then throttling back on some other aspect of my training just as you would for glutes? Because that seems to be what I'm taking from what you've said so far.

2 (2h 10m 20s):
So absolutely add volume to the lagging part and take some volume away. You can't just hammer everything. And I think that's one of the main limiters of especially men but also women with glutes. Like you want to do every movement there is. And people, I want people to understand how easy it is to maintain size and strength. There's this classic study by Bickle it, it took, they took, they looked at young and older subjects. I'm just gonna focus on the younger subjects, but I think it was like four months. They did a, like a, they hammered quads like three times a week with three sets of squats, three sets of leg press, three sets of leg extensions three times a week.

2 (2h 11m 9s):
All

0 (2h 11m 9s):
Three of those three times a week.

2 (2h 11m 11s):
All three, three times a week. Okay. Grew their quads. Quads got way bigger, 27 sets. And then one group just stopped training. One group did one third the volume, so just one day a week. So instead of three days a week, they just did that same workout one day a week and one group did one ninth. The volume meaning one meaning just one set of squats, one set of leg press, one set of leg extensions. So it went from doing 27 sets a week to just three sets. And you look at it, they maintained most of their size and strength for

0 (2h 11m 45s):
Doing just one set for like,

2 (2h 11m 47s):
For like six months

0 (2h 11m 49s):
Doing just one set of

2 (2h 11m 52s):
Squats, one set of leg press, one set of leg extensions. And so you can maintain very, that was like his classic paper that, but I, I kind of realized that too. I'm like man, it's really easy to maintain strength and size once you've built it up. It's hard to build, it's easy to maintain. And that could have something to do with this Muscle Memory concept where it's like, well Muscle Memory has an epigenetics component to it and then a my nuclear component to it. But once you've gotten those nuclei fused as extra nuclear from the stem cells of the muscle stem cells, the satellite cells and now they're now in the nucle, they're now in the muscle fiber, they're there to stay.

2 (2h 12m 32s):
That's, that's kind of debated but it's, but as long as you're lifting weights, it's hard to gain, it's easy to maintain. So sticking with this concept of of like maintain certain muscles, we know from the extreme high volume literature that for brief periods if you specialize you can blast a muscle with high volume and it can grow it. You know, it's almost like the more the the, the more the merrier. Which is crazy for me 'cause there's now five studies I believe there's the first was this rat study, then there was schoenfeld two by Ennis. There's another one I'm forgetting. But the, these are five studies showing that over 30 sets a week, you get more, you know, dose response, you get more growth, the more volume you that you do.

2 (2h 13m 16s):
Some, some influences of argued that it's just swelling. You're getting more swelling. But that is doubtful based on a study. I think it was from Brafa looked at like cell, like the swelling three days after and five days after. It looks like that's legit. But all of us know that's not sustainable. You can't just do 30 sets for every muscle group indefinitely. That's the recipe for disaster. What people should be looking at is, wow, you can blast a muscle with high volume for brief periods and grow. So what, what is, how's this translate for lagging muscles? For a lot of my followers, they're just on a permanent Glute specialization routine. They want glutes so much and they, they don't want other muscles.

2 (2h 13m 58s):
Like a lot of my followers are like, I don't really care about my upper body or my quads or my hams. I just want bigger

0 (2h 14m 4s):
Glutes. This is mostly female followers.

2 (2h 14m 5s):
Mostly female followers. But I will say a lot of men care about, we care about every muscle and we kinda look in the mirror and it's whatever your weak part is. Some people it's their calves. Some people it's this. So can you fall this?

0 (2h 14m 16s):
Unfortunately it's not most, most guys neck. I see that a lot of guys need Neck Training. Yeah. And they don't do it. They don't do it. And it's amazing how Neck Training can positively affect the, the male aesthetic. Like you look at a, a strong neck makes somebody look strong. It also incidentally makes other Lifts like for upper body go way up. You know guys,

2 (2h 14m 37s):
I look at your neck is jacked but you've trained it for how many years?

0 (2h 14m 40s):
I trained my neck twice a week. How many years?

2 (2h 14m 42s):
I've

0 (2h 14m 42s):
Done it for, I can't remember how many years. Many years. Like

2 (2h 14m 45s):
10 years.

0 (2h 14m 46s):
At least 10 years. And I was just, yeah,

2 (2h 14m 47s):
Because you have a thick neck and there's a study on that. 'cause the, the old adage was just do you don't need to train your neck If you do deadlifts, shrugs, you know rows, it's gonna grow. No it doesn't. This study showed that they had one group doing that. Just the deadlifts, the shrugs, the rows and another group doing neck flexion extension. The group doing the, the deadlifts and, and shrugs, they grew their traps but not their neck muscles at all. If you wanna grow the neck muscles, you have to train the neck muscles.

0 (2h 15m 17s):
It's so critical. The neck is the upper spine. And and also nowadays everyone's hunched over in the CSCS shape position 'cause we're texting all the time and we're sitting too much. But Jeff Cavalier has a great video on how to properly train the neck using a plate in the gym wrapped in a towel. How to do this with the mouth closed, nasal breathing tongue on the roof of the mouth. There are a lot of things you can do wrong. So Neck Training I think has to be approached correctly. And bridges are prob, according to Jeff are probably not the best thing because you can slip a disc and it happens in a moment. I think Neck Training is vital. I think women shy away from Neck Training because they don't want a larger neck, which I, and so I haven't quite figured out the solution to hand off to them. And I'm not a, again, I'm not a trainer. This is just my experience.

2 (2h 15m 55s):
You go low volume with like, so I, I agree with you. Like, and it's funny, I have an identical twin brother and he, he's always like, man I love your neck is bigger. I have this little bobblehead. Yeah

0 (2h 16m 4s):
You have a properly sized and shaped

2 (2h 16m 6s):
Neck. But I don't, I don't do Neck Training. But I think what happens is a lot of people like pull downs in military press and even like bench can irritate people's necks because we flex it. When I bench, I always want to be here. When I compete in a power lifting contest, I to learn how to, I see I had to learn how to keep my head back. So a lot of times we're just Flexing it isometrically. And I think that's what I do when I'm doing like chin ups and stuff and I'm always like, ugh, Flexing isometrically, which can provide a stimulus. I'd get bigger, a bigger nap if I train it by that. I think that's the hard part is I love having strong forearms. I love grip training. I love every muscle. How do you work it together in a comprehensive program and do it week in and week out? That's the hard part is how to train everything.

2 (2h 16m 46s):
So we end up going the six Lifts we mentioned, you know, you're gonna get most of your muscles even like dead Lifts are gonna train your grip muscles. But it's like, then how do you, how do you hit all of 'em for, for maximum function? How do you strengthen everything? Well

0 (2h 17m 1s):
I think timewise

2 (2h 17m 2s):
And not get distracted. 'cause timewise you're right. Yeah. I think the problem is when you try to say I want every muscle in the body. I'm gonna do, you know, 20 sets for my forearms, 20 sets for my biceps, my triceps, each head of the de, my traps, my pecs, my lats and upper pecs, lower pecs, upper lats, lower lats, erectors, glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves, adductors, you name it, I want it. And then you, it's a recipe for disaster. So you have to specialize a little bit based on your goals, your, your preferences, your individual weaknesses as per your anatomy. And that's where you could say, look, what we've talked about throughout this podcast gives people some tools.

2 (2h 17m 43s):
It's like, look, the first set is the most important. It's for bringing up lagging muscle groups. But also what if you just wanted to maximize Hypertrophy? What if a bodybuilder a pro? Like what if I, it would be kind of cool if I could test this theory. I just don't think anyone would want to train this way. If you said, look, I'm gonna go on this blast and cruise type philosophy where it's hard to build, easy to maintain. So in try, instead of trying to build everything at once, I'm gonna really prioritize one muscle from the upper body and one muscle from the lower body or two each month. So month one it's, you know, it's quads and pecs and month two it's back in hamstrings, month three it's delts and then glutes and adductors.

2 (2h 18m 32s):
'cause they kind of go together. Maybe you throw arms into that delts and arms and then you know, glutes and adductors and then you rotate, you rotate through that cycle and you're doing all of it. You're just skewing the volume a lot and the, and the focus, the Progressive Overload focus. So on the months that you're maintaining, you're just trying to do one or two sets, limited volume, trying to maintain your strength. Correct.

0 (2h 18m 54s):
Exercise two or three exercise. Yeah, well this

2 (2h 18m 55s):
Is, but then you're really blasting the muscle that you're focused on. Theoretically those would grow a lot during the focus month and then they'd maintain, maybe that's a better way to grow muscle is just, no one would ever do it to

0 (2h 19m 6s):
Me. What you described for glutes and what you're describing now for essentially any body part, there's a common theme here, which is that short periods of let's say four to six weeks, a prioritization training with more a muscle three times a week, different movements, perhaps even different rep ranges. And th and this is the key thing that I'm taking away from what you said and then throttling back on the volume for other muscle groups, not panicking that you're gonna lose all your development in these other muscle groups is really what allows you to bring everything up to the more or less same level. And yet I also agree with the last sentence you said most people lack the discipline or the, just the ability to throttle back on the volume of work for body parts that they're strong in.

0 (2h 19m 53s):
Because it feels so damn good to train the things that you're strong in. And yet it's the exact opposite of what we need to do.

2 (2h 19m 59s):
I did that for doubts, but it gets to a point where I'm so sick of doing dealt raises for the front side and rear de you just get so sick of it. But I would do a lot of variety, but I started training more volume, more Frequency. I wasn't necessarily focused on Progressive Overload either. Like I've preached Progressive Overload, but my delts grew at the age of 48, 4, now I'm 49, but they grew last year, which is hard to do at our age to have your all time best dealts after all these years of lifting. But I used, I, I incorporated a lot of variety. I was doing length and partials, cables, machines, dumbbells bands. I was doing it all. And just the extra volume grew my dealts.

2 (2h 20m 41s):
I didn't get stronger at shoulder press or lateral raises. I was just hitting 'em more frequently. Doing more volume. You reach a point where you're sick of it and you're like, I can't, I don't want do any more delt raises. So it naturally lends itself to like four weeks spurts. You know, I do do it for four weeks and I throttle back with grip training. I was always like, man, I'll never be able to hold onto the bar with my max deadlift weight. And then I did a powerlifting competition a lot of years ago. I'm like, shoot, I can't wear straps. I gotta strengthen my grip. Well what I learned was like chalk adds like 80 pounds to my grip. Mixed grip adds another 80 pounds and using a really neural bar adds like another 80 pounds to my grips.

2 (2h 21m 22s):
So I've gotten to where I, I almost deadlifted 6 75 once I got it so close to being locked out, but I could hold onto the bar. I, once I focused on my grip training for like two, three months, I got it super strong. Now I don't have to train it that much. Every once in a while I notice, okay, my grip limited, my deadlift, I gotta train a few sessions and it's back to good. It's like you blend that into your, your motor programmer or something. Now you use it more and it, it's easier to maintain it for some reason, but you gotta put in that work up front. So these are just things that kind of led lend credence to what you're saying.

David Protein (2h 21m 58s):
I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our Sponsors, David. David makes a protein bar, unlike any other. It has 28 grams of protein, only 150 calories and zero grams of sugar. That's right. 28 grams of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein. This is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar. David protein bars also taste amazing. Even the texture is amazing. My favorite bar is the chocolate chip cookie dough. But then again, I also like the new chocolate peanut butter flavor and the chocolate brownie flavored. Basically I like all the flavors a lot. They're all incredibly delicious. In fact, the toughest challenge is knowing which ones to eat on which days and how many times per day. I limit myself to two per day, but I absolutely love them. With David, I'm able to get 28 grams of protein in the calories of a snack, which makes it easy to hit my protein goals of one gram of protein per pound of body weight per day. And it allows me to do so without ingesting too many calories. I'll eat a David Protein bar most afternoons as a snack and I always keep one with me when I'm out of the house or traveling. They're incredibly delicious and given that they have 28 grams of protein, they're really satisfying for having just 150 calories. If you'd like to try David, you can go to david protein.com/huberman. Again, that's david protein.com/huberman.

0 (2h 23m 13s):
I take one week off every say 14 to 16 weeks. I just don't lift on purpose. Sometimes life events dictate that most often. It's deliberate, it's scheduled and I do it because it keeps things fresh and I notice it hasn't hurt me. But what are your thoughts on layoffs of a week or longer in terms of them being beneficial? I mean, I will say if I go much longer than a week, like I've gone 10 days before and I'm just going crazy. I wanna get back in the gym and train and I'm doing other things. I'm running, I'm doing exercise, I'm moving.

0 (2h 23m 53s):
Or if I'm on vacation, typically I'm walking a ton, like, like 40,000 steps a day. Like I'm backpacking or I'm doing some other movement of some kind. But if, if I take more than 10 days off, I then then start to notice that my urge to train actually starts to diminish again. And then I start training again and it kind of comes back. So there's clearly something there and everybody's different. But what are your thoughts on layoffs of a week or longer? Do you, are you okay with your client saying, you know, I'm gonna take a week off and go to Hawaii and I'm just not gonna lift, I'm just gonna lay around on the beach and have a good time. Or you know, what, what are your thoughts on, on extended layoffs?

2 (2h 24m 31s):
So this was something in the like early two thousands, I think his name was Brian Cock. He, he, he had this Hypertrophy specific training and he called it strategic reconditioning or something like that. And we, you know, we always thought maybe there's something to it where it primes your, you then it primed you to get newbie gains again. Or at least it will actually help you grow more muscle. But it was always just kind of a theory. But in practice a lot of bodybuilders don't tend to do that. They tend to tend to train you round. But the thing is you need to deload. It's really hard to not get nagging pain. And it is, it's, it's important to not necessarily take a week off but chill for at least a few days, maybe a whole week.

2 (2h 25m 18s):
But this was recently put to to the test in the literature taking a week off. Brad Schoenfeld was on that paper and what they found was you didn't see better benefits taking the week off, but you also didn't lose much. So it's like, but what I wanna talk about is this literature, I'm, I'm not well versed in it, I'd have to go back and look, but it's people who did Periodic Training. Like if you train for a few weeks and then take a a week off and then train for a few for a few weeks, you, yes, you lose strength. You decondition, you lose strength and some size, but you quickly gain it back. And this whole notion that you have to be training year round all the time, it's just not evidence based.

2 (2h 26m 3s):
Based on a few studies that have shown that you, they show similar results with people that take some periodic time off. You gain it back quickly due to like Muscle Memory. Here's where it can be beneficial. If it helps your psychological Desire to Train or, or if it helps heel nagging injuries or pain, then it can be beneficial. I don't recommend it to my followers, but I do recommend having times where you chill. Life sometimes forces you into that. You either get sick or you get injured or you have to go on a vacation and you just don't have access to a gym. But I tend to just listen to my body.

2 (2h 26m 45s):
And there are just times where you're pushing it hard and you just feel beat up and it's like have a few easy days. It doesn't have to be a week. It doesn't have to be, could just be three training days and you'll come back refreshed. But I think it's a vital, necessary, crucial component of long-term lifting. And if you don't do that, you are going to, it'll end up hurting you. It's, it's, you can't just train. It's like how do you, how do you make sure you're not overreaching? Like how do you nail that perfect volume and effort and where you're not pushing it too hard, where you're not inhi inhi inhibiting your muscle activation because you get things perfect and you can't predict your sleep and your stress and your recovery physiology all the time.

2 (2h 27m 32s):
So I think it's a good idea to chill for a little bit and do lesser volume or do different exercises that are just easier on the body and then you'll be pleasantly surprised. Like, well, and what I always like doing with my clients is, and that's what I like with my, my booty by Brett programming is I want my clients to know you don't have to squat and deadlift you round when you're doing a step up or a lunge with weight. That two studies show that one on step ups, one on Bulgarian split squats. One group did bilateral, one group did single leg and they both gained the same squat strength. And I'm not gonna tell, you know, the world's strongest powerlifter don't squat. You can maintain all your squat strength with single leg training.

2 (2h 28m 13s):
But for the masses, yes it's a single leg squat pattern is the squat pattern. It builds your bilateral double leg strength as well. You don't have to do every lift year round. They transfer each other. Pick one, one exercise from that pattern and trust that you're gonna maintain most of your strength. Yes, when you have the the squat focused month and you put deadlifts and hip thrusts on the back burner the next month, yes you're squat, you set a PR in squats on week four you're feeling good. You start off the new month now focusing on say, dead Lifts or Hip Thrust, maybe you lost some strength but it quickly comes back and now by week four you can PR on that too. Things come back. You don't always have to.

2 (2h 28m 53s):
And I think that's something that's really hard for people. You get so tied to the Lifts themselves, you get so tied to the routine and the I have to be doing every exercise. If I stop deadlifting, I'm gonna shrink. If I stop squatting, I'm gonna shrink. And the body's pretty resilient. You maintain your muscle, you maintain your strength. If you have to do a single leg pattern or, or if you're just training the movement patterns, you will retain those. If you're training it third in the workout, not setting prs, but you're just doing it. Like I was really focusing on squats and deadlifts for like three, four months. And I do Hip Thrust, just lightweight mind muscle connection focused. But I'm focusing on the squeeze position. So I'm maintaining my squeeze strength that way.

2 (2h 29m 36s):
I'm focusing on my stretch strength through squats and devs. So the second I said I'm gonna do Hip Thrust first today, I haven't done Hip Thrust first in three months, four months. I did 'em first in the workout and I tied three prs. I did three sets and all three tied prs because I had that bottom position strength through the squats and the dead Lifts. I had that top strength by doing the, the mind muscle connection stuff. It was there. I just was always training in a fatigued state. I think there's a benefit to mixing it around for that reason. So it translates. And I wish more people knew, especially when you're in pain, if squats are hurting you, don't do it for a while. Find a suitable alternative. If deadlifts are hurting you don't do it for while.

2 (2h 30m 17s):
If Hip Thrust are hurting you don't do it for a while. And the thing with Hip Thrust people say you, you see on the internet people saying, oh, Hip Thrust are bad for your back. Well, or like especially the scoop method is bad for your back. No, the scoop method is better for your back. But Hip Thrust don't hurt your back if you're doing it properly. You know what the, what limits you is the bruising on your Hip Dips when you get freakish, you strong. I have clients that are female clients that are hip thrusting in the 700 pounds. Ooh yeah, they're freaks. I have like five that have Hip Thrust over 600 pounds, maybe six. But yeah, most of them can do three 15 for 24 0 5 for 10, 4 95 for five.

2 (2h 30m 57s):
Most of them can do that. And they weigh like an average of like 140 pounds because like you go to a power lifting gym And what do they have? Squat racks. You go to a Olympic lifting a training center, they have platforms with squat stands. You go to a Glute lab, you're gonna have 10 Hip Thrust stations, you're gonna see 10 people hip thrusting. We get really freakishly good at Hip Thrust. But the what limits people is the bruising and the pain at the Hip Dips. So especially if you use like a rotisserie Hip Thrust, you get it, you can use about 10 to 20% more weight. They're typically the day after they really crush rotisserie. They're Hip Dips or beat up, they're bruised or you could get abrasions or like sores there.

2 (2h 31m 40s):
So they're going coach my Hip Dips hurt. Okay, what do you do instead of the Hip Thrust? Now you do single leg Hip Thrust or you have partner Hip Thrust, you have someone sit backwards on your lap 'cause the surface area is spread out and you Hip Thrust a human for high reps. 'cause it doesn't hurt. It doesn't, it lets those parts heal. So we have to mix things around. We have to switch it up. Also if, yeah, sometimes Hip Thrust can make your knees a little sore if you do pause reps or like band bar plus band where you add extra resistance to make the top harder. So everything requires, it's a think the iron game is a thinking man's game. You can get great gains doing the very basics.

2 (2h 32m 22s):
What we talked about in the beginning, the the listeners are gonna be overwhelmed. It's gonna be like, look, just do two full body workouts a week two hard sets warm up, two hard sets in any rep range. 'cause the rep range doesn't matter so much. You can Gain Muscle with lower reps, medium reps or higher reps. Mix it up to keep it interesting. Do you know you'll get most of your gains doing it that way. You'll get 85% of your gains doing it that way. And you'll, the benefit is you won't be beat up, you'll be recovered and you'll be motivated to lift because you'll be looking forward to gonna the gym. All this other stuff is for the extra 15%. The guys who are really into it, the people who are obsessed with it, like, like us, we're

0 (2h 33m 5s):
Guys and gals. You're talking about men

2 (2h 33m 6s):
And women? Yeah. Yeah. And, and with guys it tends to be full body Hypertrophy with women, it tends to be more Glute specific 'cause that's the, that's what's popular, what's what's in vogue right now. But yeah, the, this extra 15%, it's a thinking man's game thinking woman's game and it's, you know, you gotta use strategy, you gotta learn somewhat, you know about the biomechanics and the physiology, but that's what makes it so fun and like we're able to learn new things as we're approaching 50. How cool is

0 (2h 33m 35s):
That? Yeah, it's an endless progression and I would say learn to enjoy training hard, which means different things for different people. People have different schedules, different pain thresholds, different goals. But there are many, as you were saying yesterday, there are many paths to Rome. I really appreciate you taking so much time to be so thorough about what most people need at the beginning, what everyone needs at some point in terms of specialization and how to specialize. Because at something that's not discussed often enough with respect to balancing out aesthetics, strength and just staying uninjured. And also it adds the novelty component. It makes it fun. Yep.

0 (2h 34m 16s):
We have some questions from the audience. Literally I solicited on Social Media for questions. I'm gonna do something I rarely do during the podcast, which is to bring out my phone because I need to bring out my phone to get the questions that people listed off. And there are a ton of questions. So one of the most common questions here is what rep ranges should somebody use in order to bring up a lagging body part? So let's assume it's glutes or arms. In this case it was arms seems to be a, a male in this case. So not surprisingly arms. What rep ranges should they use?

2 (2h 34m 53s):
So classic Brad Schoenfeld paper. Three sets of three versus three sets of 10. On the squat, three sets of 10 grew more muscle, but in general, lightweight and heavyweight grow similar amounts of muscle, but you have to reach a certain amount of reps. The consensus is about five or six. So say it's six, you have to do at least six reps. But it could be all the way up to 30. They grow the same amount of muscle. There is some argument as to whether high reps create more muscle damage. There seems to be evidence of that. So if you train a muscle frequently, the lower side of things might be better. It also is kind of exercise dependent, like single joint movements tend to be better done with higher reps.

2 (2h 35m 33s):
I think that's my opinion. But generally you could do, if you like doing low reps, you could do sets of six and grow just fine. If you love higher reps, you could do sets of 20 to 30 and grow just fine. I think variety's always the best case because it's boring and it, it's kind of like different stress on the body to spare the joints. But if you don't like going heavy, you never have to, if you don't like going super high ups, you never have to.

0 (2h 35m 57s):
Lots of questions here about calves in the video. We talked a little bit about this or a lot about this. I have an asymmetry in calves due to an injury on my left calf, but it's coming up like last couple months. It's really been moving and the tips you gave me yesterday, and again there's a link to this in the show note captions were super helpful in particular around standing calf raises and about the emphasizing partials in the stretched position at the end of the set. Could you reiterate those points and add to those points? Many people here want to grow their calves.

2 (2h 36m 33s):
All right, calves are so genetic. So you have, you have good calf Genetics, you don't even need to train 'em. They're just huge. You have poor calf Genetics. You might be feeling like, man, I can't do anything to bring 'em up. The evidence emerging is that there's not much use for seated calf raises or for really focusing on the top squeeze position. Calves respond good to stretch and you can do just straight up full range standing calf raises. You could also just do lengthened partials where you just do like the bottom half. And if you do full range cal raises, you might benefit from doing extended partials like length and super sets where you keep going.

2 (2h 37m 18s):
You might be able to do three to five more reps at the end just doing the bottom portion. Focus on the stretch with calves.

0 (2h 37m 26s):
Fantastic. Many questions about can a person grow muscle after age 40? And I'm going to dovetail this with the several questions from the women who ask, can one build more muscle starting resistance training for the first time in Perimenopause or Menopause, which is essentially a age question as well, but it it weaves in additional women specific issues.

2 (2h 37m 55s):
Absolutely. But it just matters when you, like whenever you start, if you start training in your eighties, I think, I think there's even evidence in maybe 90 year olds they can grow muscle. Awesome. But the caveat is that you start, like you Andrew, you and I won't be able to have this much muscle when we're 90. Obviously

0 (2h 38m 13s):
I disagree.

2 (2h 38m 14s):
You, you, I, I hope you, I hope you're right. Well maybe, we'll maybe you'll figure out these pro with your protocols, but my point is if you, if you start training when you're 15 and you, and you train optimally throughout your whole life, there will be a point where you peak with your muscle mass and then it where there'll be a point. But it's, the point is it's further than people think. People used to think, well you'll probably start losing muscle mass in your thirties. No, it's probably more like in your fifties. You can maintain all of it, but if you haven't started lifting, you will absolutely get grow muscle. Will a 70-year-old who starts training for the first time grow muscle as much as you will when you're in your twenties?

2 (2h 38m 58s):
No, but you still will grow. It's just blunted a little bit. You know, age tends to dull everything, but you can absolutely grow and you should absolutely start

0 (2h 39m 8s):
A couple of questions about muscle growth and maintenance training for women during pregnancy.

2 (2h 39m 14s):
Strength training during pregnancy is very well researched. It, it is absolutely something you should do. It improves your outcomes with almost everything, you know, pregnancy delivery related. But there's a caveat that if you don't, if you haven't lifted weights, you might not want to start lifting weights while you're pregnant. But you can absolutely, if you've been, if you're an avid lifter and you get pregnant, you should absolutely continue training first trimester. This is generalizing, but first trimester you feel more morning sickness, you feel icky, it's hard to stay motivated and you feel you get morning sickness and like then second trimester things return more to normal and your bacteria yourself again.

2 (2h 40m 1s):
And then third trimester is kind of day by day your belly's getting in the way. Some days feel off, but you will find movements that work well for you. Sumo squats tend to be well tolerated, you know, but you, you can even Hip Thrust while you're pregnant, you just don't let the bar push into your belly. You keep it on the upper thighs and you don't go as deep do smith machine and keep it on your upper thighs so it's not pushing against your belly. And you'll do just fine, but you will find, you will be able to go to the gym. You might be able to leg press. You can always stay moving and stay fit.

0 (2h 40m 36s):
Several people asked how to grow lower glutes so they don't droop. I'm assuming they're talking about the region of the glutes right above the hamstrings. And they're talking about presumably excess body fat and lack of muscle Hypertrophy underneath. And it sounds like there's a a, a growing, it's like a Glute hamstring, like adipose hinge. You know, it's like, I think what they're describing, I think I understand this question, maybe

2 (2h 41m 7s):
You do well, they, they just don't want Saggy Glutes and they wanna focus more on that. You want that?

0 (2h 41m 12s):
What sagging though? Is it the body fat or is it the, the muscle that's sagging, it's the body fat.

2 (2h 41m 16s):
But if you had big glutes and you had that same amount of fat, it would look better if you had like stretch,

0 (2h 41m 21s):
Stretch out over larger muscles.

2 (2h 41m 23s):
Yeah, exactly. So it's the, it's the, it's the not having muscle and having more fat and that, that droopy appearance. So yes, get strong at, you know, lunges, step up squats, R DLS and Hip Thrust. They will all grow your glutes well. They will all hit the lower glutes. Well, and, and don't just do the x-rays, get stronger at them and then obviously you want to have a an optimal body composition for you. Some women have what I call like genetic BBL programming. It's like

0 (2h 41m 57s):
What does BL stand

2 (2h 41m 58s):
For? BBL stands for the Brazilian butt lift. It's the fat injections into your glutes. They take, I think they take fat from your stomach and inject it into your glutes. And it's, it's really popular now especially, you know, I'm in Fort Lauder now and the Miami, it's very common and it's very common in like South American cultures. But some of my clients, you know, if they have like Caribbean or South American heritage, it's like they, they gain weight, they keep their, they keep like a lean Abs and all their weight just goes to their butt. They're just genetic, genetic genetically

0 (2h 42m 36s):
Blessed. So they're happy and they're happy that way, right?

2 (2h 42m 38s):
Yeah they, they can carry off carry, they can pull off, you know 30% body fat looking, looking really aesthetically pleasing for their goals whereas other people can't. And so other people, you know, put on fe like men tend to store fat more in their bellies that we have different festers but just even with women, these tend to store store fat differently. If you store it like around your entire gluten, it just makes it rounder versus kind of going to your saddle bag areas and just making the lower look really saggy. So you're gonna have to figure out your optimal body fat percentage and get there through diet and activity. But you can improve just through Recomp like gaining strength in your glutes specifically on those exercise.

2 (2h 43m 23s):
And it'll just look better and better

0 (2h 43m 24s):
Related to that, can somebody Gain Muscle while losing fat either by training while in a caloric maintenance or deficit phase? So

2 (2h 43m 37s):
What the literature, I've probably written more on this than anyone. In fact, Brad and Allen and of my, two of my best friends, Brad Schoenfeld, Allen Aragon, I argue with them all the time about this and they think that you should bulk and cut. You see better results that way. I don't think, I mean there's one this, this Helms study by Eric Helms and it showed that adding like a, basically they, the subjects gained just as much muscle in maintenance as they did with surplus. And all these studies on big surpluses just show that you gain more fat. This is a very controversial topic and most people will disagree with me on this, but I will say what is the stimulus for growing? Gaining muscle is working hard in the gym and pring do you have to be in a caloric surplus?

2 (2h 44m 21s):
The evidence doesn't appear. So I will tell you, most of my clients, Recomp, they come to me. I attract already fit people who come to me and then I don't, I don't, I say, do you get enough protein? They say yes, I get around a pound per, sorry, I get around a gram per pound of body weight per day. And I say, good, I'm not gonna touch your diet. Let's just get strong. And they Recomp, I've had clients that train with me for a whole year. They stayed 135 pounds the whole year and at the end of the year they show me, Brett, look at my jeans. I have this crazy like five inch gap of the old jeans they used to wear, meaning they stayed the same weight but they lost all that their waist. 'cause you Lose Fat from the problem areas.

2 (2h 45m 2s):
You Gain Muscle in the muscle bellies that make you more look more athletic and it changes your, your appearance and your body composition a ton. Even though the scale weight doesn't change. But if you do want a bulk and cut, what I will say is just do Mini Bulks and Mini Cuts. Just gain five pounds and lose five pounds. You don't have to put on 30 pounds. That's old way of thinking. And, and I think it does more harm than good men. We can bulk and we don't mind the way we look a little bit. We're like look at check out trap Zillow. Women don't like the Bulks as much. They don't, they don't

0 (2h 45m 34s):
Like, I don't like bulking, man. I yeah, I I

2 (2h 45m 36s):
You don't have to. I

0 (2h 45m 37s):
Don't, I I, I think I've done it once or twice many years ago. I don't like feeling weighed down with all that extra extra food and your digestion it like you're constantly eating or going to the bathroom. It makes you sleepy. Like I think maintenance plus a couple hundred extra calories with, with

2 (2h 45m 54s):
Many Bulks Mini Cuts. But no one has to do these huge Bulks and Cuts. You get these bodybuilding coaches that push that onto like, you know, lifestyle clients or like clients that are already obese and or like, or like very overweight and you're like, why are you, they just need to cut. They need to cut down per until they get down to the healthy body fat level. So you, you know, I just want people to be more familiar with re comping. I've written a about a lot check it out re comping.

0 (2h 46m 22s):
I'll just add to that because I can't resist when people bulk, their skin gets really bad that you can, they get acne and all sorts of stuff. Kyle Gillette, Dr. Kyle Gillette, he's an MD who's been a guest on this podcast, clarified a lot of things for me. And I think a lot of other people, when he said people that are carrying excess body fat, when they reduce the amount of fat they're carrying their hormone profiles improve. People who are already really lean, if they go really self-maintenance calories, their Hormones tend to suffer. This is true for women. They sometimes will stop having periods, but also for men, their testosterone will drop if they're eating too few calories.

0 (2h 47m 2s):
But men who are carrying too much body fat who lose body fat, their testosterone increases. So these rules about, you know, you, if you cut calories, your, your testosterone drops depends on where you're starting from in women

2 (2h 47m 14s):
As well. So it's stay in healthy body fat range, right? Yeah, maybe it's like 10 to 20% for men, maybe it's 15 to 25% for women and just Recomp. But if you're not in that range, if you're lower then you need a bulk to be in an optimal hormonal profile. If you're overweight, you need to lose weight. So bulk and cutting is a strategy, but when you're in your healthy range, you don't have to, there's not much evidence. And if you do do it, do Mini, Mini bulk, Mini cut.

0 (2h 47m 38s):
I have a feeling I know the answer to this question and it probably can be answered in one word. Lifting or Pilates for Strength training.

2 (2h 47m 46s):
Lifting.

0 (2h 47m 47s):
Thank you. How to grow glutes without growing legs And can Hip Dips be induced by lifting?

2 (2h 47m 57s):
So those are two important questions. Okay, question one. I was the first person to make this a thing 'cause I had so many women come to me back in like 2009, 2010. I think my first blog post was 2010 and I made two YouTube videos on how to grow your glutes without growing your legs. It's tricky because most of the best Glute exercises are leg exercises. So you have to cut all of 'em out. If you want to grow your glutes without growing your legs, the nice thing is the plot can study and then a couple subsequent studies, this barmy paper, it shows you can grow your glutes similarly effectively as like squats and step ups for example through Hip Thrust.

2 (2h 48m 39s):
So you can do Hip Thrust, you can do kickbacks, you could do 45 degree hypers, you can do abduction, but you can't do all the squats and lunges and even the, you know, stiff leg deadlifts and stuff like that. You want to minimize those and just focus on most of the isolation Lifts. And you can probably do more volume for those. So here you could just do Hip Thrust and kickbacks and abduction three times a week And do, you know, you might do, you might do four sets of each 'cause they don't make you real sore, but you require a separate strategy if you don't want the leg growth. But I will say many women think that they don't want the leg growth because they have fat on their legs and once they lean out they actually like the way their legs look.

2 (2h 49m 19s):
So a lot of people improperly throw themselves into that category. And then the second question is, can you induce Hip Dips through weight training? Yes. Hip Dips, which are, they're the hollow point formed from where the Glute medias meets the Glute maximus. They're like, you could put

0 (2h 49m 36s):
It like a golf ball or tennis ball like on your hip and it kind of fits.

2 (2h 49m 40s):
Not really one stick. That'd be pretty amazing. But like it's a hollow area and from the front you'll see like the,

0 (2h 49m 47s):
No, I mean if, are you talking about like if one lies on their side, it's like an area that you could Oh sure, yeah you could like ideally that,

2 (2h 49m 53s):
But they'd probably have to be Flexing. But yeah, like that it would

0 (2h 49m 55s):
Stay

2 (2h 49m 56s):
Put. Yeah it would stay put if they're laying on their side. But I, I've talked about this for a long time, I will tell you if you get lean you have to have Hip Dips. If you're lean, there's no muscle there. It's where the Glute medias comes down, straight down the Glute max runs diagonally and there's a hollow point in the middle where there is no muscle there. So when people come up with this hip dip workouts, they're full of it. You can't grow muscle in an imaginary space. You get lean enough and you know, so like the solution is to get fat put in there or if hopefully you store fat there. But once you get lean enough, we all have Hip Dips. So learn how to embrace them. The funny thing is you think of like Ronnie Coleman from behind Flexing his Glute like posing yes you see this butterfly shape, the glutes are like a butterfly shape but his Hip Dips don't look bad 'cause you got these giant VAEs, the outer quads that, but with with women without those outer quads it can look unsightly.

2 (2h 50m 53s):
But that's because we've programmed to be worried about it. Learn to embrace it and say I like the Hip Dips, it means I'm lean, it means I'm strong, it means I'm muscular and athletic. And it's just something that is hard to avoid if you're training properly and getting lean. But can you make 'em worse through strength training? Yes, in my opinion because you make it more pronounced and you get leaner. So if you're worried really worried about it, try to maintain a higher body fat percentage and maybe don't train as much Glute medias and frontal plane, hip abduction. Do seated hip abduction instead of like what we did yesterday, which was more upright. 'cause maybe that maybe growing the Glute medias and minimus, especially the middle and anterior divisions.

2 (2h 51m 33s):
But I will say all of my clients do plenty of abduction work and they look fine.

0 (2h 51m 39s):
There's some really entertaining questions in here that are really specific to the topics that you cover and are expert in. I understand that there's no such thing as Spot Reduction, but if somebody wants to Lose Fat from their abdominal region, is there anything they can do to accelerate loss of fat in that region?

2 (2h 51m 60s):
We've known that Spot Reduction is a myth since like the nineties research showing that yeah you can do all the crunches you want. It doesn't target Fat Loss in that area. You can build muscle and so you can have site specific muscle growth but not site specific Fat Loss. Fat Loss comes off from the entire body, which you do through caloric deficit, through eating less, moving more or combin any combination thereof. But also through Recomp because if you gain five pounds, if you weigh 200 pounds and you gain 10 pounds of muscle, lose 10 pounds of fat, you know you've just lost 10 pounds of fat, your your 5% less body fat levels, you're gonna have less fat. You know like, so it's through, you can do it through like that's not to say you shouldn't ever train your Abs, it's just to say that your Abs tend to look the best when you're your leanest, not when you're training your Abs the most.

0 (2h 52m 52s):
Aesthetically speaking, should people train glutes differently depending on whether or not they have wide versus narrow Hip Dips? And I believe this is a woman asking the question.

2 (2h 53m 4s):
Yeah, so theoretically, like it doesn't just depend on the Hip Dips, it depends on like how the femur, 'cause I wrote about this in my book, I, I just think people get like should you train differently for your Glute Genetics? Maybe if you feel like you're kind of like a V-shaped glutes, then maybe you do more lower glutes and not as much upper, maybe you don't do abduction. But most of my clients train glutes the same way.

0 (2h 53m 33s):
A lot of questions about Grip Strength. You talked a little bit about training Grip Strength. If somebody wanted to add some Grip Strength, maybe not do a full specialization phase of four weeks, but maybe they just wanted to add some Grip Strength and they're already hanging from the bar doing pikes for their Abs, which I would argue is one of the best exercises for Abs and grip. What specific grip grip exercise would you suggest? So assuming they're already deadlift, they're doing stuff, they're using their grip for pulling and this kind of thing hanging from the bar, what if you had give one Grip Strength exercise, what would it be?

2 (2h 54m 10s):
Well I would say if, if you're, if you tend to get beat up with your low back, then hang do static hangs or even hopefully you progress to one arm hangs where you can kind of do one arm hangs where you brace yourself on the, use the non-working arm to hold yourself in position. But if your low back is you know, stellar, then you can do shrugs, you can do farmer's walks. You know, walking is kind of hard at a gym to do, just walking around with the dumbbells, but you could just stand in place so you could do shrugs. When you can't do any more shrugs, you just hold it for time. You could also just hold the last rep of your last set of deadlifts for time. All those things help out, they all add up to improving your Grip Strength.

0 (2h 54m 53s):
Last question. What is the most unusual but effective training tip that you've never heard or seen discussed in Social Media or out there? Like what's, what's a maybe something from the past that no one talks about anymore or something that you just feel like people should talk about more in terms of training? This could be anything you like. It's like your choice.

2 (2h 55m 17s):
I would say what we talked about yesterday, the One Set to Failure, who does it, who does One Set to Failure? Two full body workouts a week. One Set to Failure

0 (2h 55m 28s):
For each body part

2 (2h 55m 29s):
For, yeah, on like six to eight exer, like six to 10 exercises per per day. You get the workout done in, you know, 45 minutes. So you're training an hour and a half a week and you probably could get 80% of your gains than you could through training, you know, for three times that much time. It's very time efficient. It's just, no one ever does it. I don't know anyone who does one set, you know, everyone does multiple sets, but it's a very efficient way to train. It's a very fun way to train because you come in with a goal, you're like, I need to try to beat my record. Well the only thing I would say is shuffle the Lifts around, shuffle the order around and shuffle the variations around because as we mentioned, you can't just keep gaining strength for years on end.

2 (2h 56m 14s):
It doesn't work that way.

0 (2h 56m 16s):
So train the whole body One Set to Failure after a sufficient warmup for each body part and do that one, two or three times a week. One, if you're gonna do it once a week, you gotta pour everything you've gotten to it. But if you do it two or three times a week, you can go,

2 (2h 56m 33s):
We talked about this yesterday. It gets to a point where you're, I got to a point where I, I suck at squats, but I was doing 2 25 for 30. I was doing my, my best stiff leg deadlift. I, it was 4 0 5 for either 20, I might've gotten 22. And then you get to a point where like, what am I gonna do go for 25? Yes, you can go heavier weight, but like it gets to the point where it's daunting, it makes you nervous just thinking about the exercise. So at that point you kind of gotta learn to, you know, that's your body may be telling you you're about to get injured, so maybe you, yeah, you switch the exercise or start doing more volume. But it's a, it's a strategy I wish more people knew about because a lot of people quit lifting because they think they have to do it for periods of time in your life where you get stressed out or like think times are tough, I gotta work harder or put more hours into work or this responsibility comes in.

2 (2h 57m 24s):
You can just, you can do brief workouts and they're very effective just doing 45 minutes a couple times a week. It'll help more people stick to weight training because they realize I don't have to be in the gym five hours a day.

0 (2h 57m 37s):
Love it. Brett Contreras, doctor Brett Contreras, excuse me, thank you so much. You've given us so much knowledge is really a masterclass and not just in Glute strengthening and Hypertrophy, but how to specialize in lagging body parts, how to prioritize training, periodized training everything from calves, arms, glutes, we talked about rep ranges. We, you know, it would take another hour to summarize everything you've told us in the preceding hours and it's just spectacular. You're one of the few people out there that is degreed in this area continues to read.

0 (2h 58m 19s):
The research is clearly a practitioner. You practice what you preach and perhaps most importantly, you train people who make phenomenal progress as a consequence of your training. And I know that you're very, very proud of your students, your clients for the hard work they put in and their dedication and the feedback they give you. And it's so wonderful that you take that and then you transmit it out to the world through your Social Media, through your, your course and here on this and on other podcasts. So you're just a wealth of knowledge and I love the extent to which you share that knowledge and with such clarity and generosity, it's just really spectacular to have this opportunity sit down with you.

0 (2h 59m 1s):
And I know everyone's learned a ton and the best part is they're gonna try this stuff, they're gonna implement it and I'm sure you're gonna get lots of questions and at the same time you've opened this treasure trove for us. So thank you for coming here today. Thank you for all the work you've done and the work that you continue to do. One thing that's very clear is that you are a lifelong learner and that you continue to bring in more knowledge and that you'll continue to share that knowledge. I also want to thank you for the in-person training session yesterday. We have a, again, a link to that in the show note caption so people can see these movements. You can see how they're supposed to be done correctly. You can see where I was making mistakes. You can see where those mistakes were corrected thanks to your instruction.

0 (2h 59m 45s):
And listen, I hope you come back again and update us on the latest that you learn and and incorporate because you're not just about the peer reviewed studies, you're about that, but you're really about the real world knowledge that works. So thank you ever so much. Well

2 (2h 59m 59s):
Let me offer my thanks right back. You are a pioneer. You have helped me with your protocols and through your focus on, you know, health and neuroscience to just with prac practical tips to help us all. I can't tell you how many people that I know follow you. And when I told them I'm gonna come on your podcast, they're like, what? It's like I finally made it in their eyes be being on your podcast. It's really cool to have you ask me to come on because men tend to invite guests on their show for what they want to learn. And you have probably 50% female listeners and they're all about the glutes.

2 (3h 0m 39s):
Even if you aren't all about the glutes or you don't care if you grow bigger glutes, a lot of your followers do. So that's where I'm glad to come in because yeah, we'll read in the comments. Most of the men will be like, just do squats and lunges and it's like the women can write back, do you do pec deck? Do you do lateral raises? Do you do curls? Then quit being hypocritical. We can isolate the glutes, we can add in more volume as long as we can recover from it, it's only gonna make our glutes even bigger. And I'm glad they got to be exposed to the, to my methods and my materials. So thank you for inviting me on. I would always love to come back in the future down the road as we learn more and share that well. So thanks right back at you.

2 (3h 1m 19s):
