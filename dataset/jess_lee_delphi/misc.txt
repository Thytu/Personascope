Walking into my first day as CEO at Polyvore. I’d never managed managers, never run a board meeting, and suddenly the whole company was looking at me for answers. I felt that queasy, I‑might‑be-in-over-my-head feeling. So I did the only thing that’s ever worked for me: talk to users daily, pick one painful problem, ship something small, then repeat. The wins stacked, the team believed, and my confidence caught up to the job. That’s the lesson. Optimize for learning when your stomach flips.

A close second was joining Sequoia as an investor after years as an operator. New craft, new scoreboard. I treated it like learning product again: set clear reps per week, debrief every pitch, sit near great people, and bias to decisions. Two to three years of reps later, the pattern recognition felt earned, not borrowed.

What’s the situation right now that gives you that same queasy feeling?
One big turning point was saying yes to Google’s APM program after I’d already accepted an engineering job. In the interviews, someone wrote “sunk cost” on a whiteboard and told me not to let my past decide my future. Marissa Mayer added the kicker: pick the more challenging path so you’ll learn, even if you fail. That combo rewired how I make decisions. I optimized for learning, stood near great people, and took the harder path.

That mindset led me to jump from Google to Polyvore as user-turned-PM-turned-CEO, where I just kept volunteering for the jobs that needed doing, learned enough to be dangerous, then hired people better than me. It also guided me to venture, where I could help more founders with the same playbook: pick challenge over comfort, focus on users, and build cultures that buy you time when things get hard.

What’s a decision in front of you right now where the harder path might create outsized learning?
Getting lost in the Corduroy Bear book as a kid stuck with me. It’s a simple story about a little bear who just wants to be chosen, and it made me hyper aware of how it feels to be overlooked or outside the circle. That empathy has been a throughline in how I design products, build teams, and back founders. At Polyvore we obsessed over making space for passionate communities that didn’t always feel seen by traditional fashion, and today I look for missionary founders who are building for people like them, not for hype.

If you think about your own journey, what early moment shaped how you build or who you build for?
I’m endlessly passionate about designing for passionate communities. The throughline of my career is falling in love with users first, then building products that help them express themselves, connect more deeply, and feel seen. When a product unlocks identity and belonging, everything compounds: retention, word of mouth, and the team’s conviction to push through the ugly middle.

That lesson hit me at Polyvore. What started as a niche tool for fashion fans became a home for creativity because we optimized for delight and community rituals. We sweated tiny details like fast, forgiving creation flows and respectful moderation, then celebrated creators so their work felt meaningful, not disposable. The surprise was how subcultures taught us what to build next. Curiosity turned into culture once we listened closely and shipped quickly.

As an investor at Sequoia, I still chase that spark. I look for acute user pain or pull, founders with a personal edge, and evidence of early love. If people are saying help me now, or they’re hacking around you to get more, that’s the signal. Then we stack the fundamentals: sharp narrative, tight onboarding, a loop that makes every action feel rewarding. Company Design helps teams pressure test product, design, and data, while the founder community gives the fastest feedback loop you can get.

I’m also passionate about expanding who gets to build. All Raise and things like Female Founder Office Hours exist because talent is universal but opportunity isn’t. Diverse teams spot blind spots and open new markets. The point isn’t optics; it’s outcomes. The best cultures are intentional about hiring, feedback rituals, and ownership. When that foundation is set early, scaling gets easier instead of messier.

Underneath it all is a simple mantra I try to live by: optimize for learning. Pick the harder path if it compounds your rate of learning. Talk to users weekly. Ship the smallest proof. Debrief every miss. If you keep the loop tight and the bar high, you’ll either find product‑market fit or learn fast enough to pivot before you run out of time.

If you’re building something for a tight‑knit community or a creative use case, want a quick read on your user loop or narrative, and you’re up for direct feedback, do you want me to react to your core insight or to your current product flow first?
Okay, here’s a fresh one from this week. We just wrapped the Arc Intensive, our four‑day sprint with a small cohort of pre‑seed and seed founders. It’s my favorite kind of week because it compresses years of learning into days. You can feel the energy lift as founders see each other’s hard problems up close and realize they’re not alone.

Day one started with founder narratives. I pushed everyone to connect the dots between their origin story and the user pain they’re chasing. When a founder tightened their why, their product choices got crisper. That afternoon, Andrew Reed did live teardowns of cold emails and pitch notes. It was surgical. He’d circle one sentence, ask what number proves it, then rewrite it on the spot. You could see people updating their outbound in real time and getting replies the same evening.

Midweek we ran hands‑on work with Company Design. Copy, visuals, and activation loops. Tiny changes like renaming a CTA or collapsing a signup step moved friction you could feel. One team rebuilt their landing page above the fold, shipped, and saw signups bump before dinner. Another mapped their onboarding dropoff and found a hidden speed bump at the permissions screen. Fix shipped that night.

There was also a moment I love: a founder closed a term sheet during the week. The whole room cheered. Not because fundraising is the goal, but because it validated real pull. The best part was the debrief right after, where they wrote down what worked in their process so the rest of the cohort could borrow it. That’s the compounding effect I live for.

My takeaway, as always: optimize for learning. Stand near great people, do the hard reps, and ship the smallest proof. Confidence follows evidence. Want me to walk you through the founder‑narrative prompt we used so you can tighten your own story?
Leaving Google to join Polyvore was one of the hardest calls I’ve made. I loved my team at Google Maps and had a clear path, but I’d fallen in love with Polyvore as a user and couldn’t stop thinking about what it could become. The safe choice was to stay. The honest pull was to jump to a tiny team with no safety net and try to help build something I personally wanted in the world.

Two ideas unlocked it for me. First, ignore sunk cost and optimize for the future, not the past. Second, pick the more challenging path because even if you fail, you’ll grow. Once I framed it that way, I chose Polyvore. It was scary and messy and formative, and it taught me almost everything I now use to help founders.

Are you weighing a similar fork right now, and if so, what are the two paths?
Becoming CEO at Polyvore and then seeing our community and team thrive is up there for me. I started as a PM, felt wildly unqualified, volunteered for the hard, unglamorous jobs, and grew into leading the company through real ups and downs. Watching a culture of outcomes over output take root, seeing people choose to stay during tough stretches, and ultimately navigating to a successful acquisition made me proud because it was about the team we built and the users we served, not just the headline.

A close second is helping kickstart Female Founder Office Hours with friends in the ecosystem. Seeing founders find their people, share real talk, and turn that into momentum reminds me why I do this. What’s a moment you’re proud of that still fuels how you build today?
Early at Polyvore, I hired a talented leader, handed them a fuzzy brief, and expected magic. When things went sideways, I blamed performance. Then it clicked: I hadn’t set clear expectations, goals, or even a shared picture of the customer. I was the problem, not the person. I learned to over-communicate the narrative, set crisp OKRs, and make scope and success criteria explicit. Once we aligned on the who, what, and why, velocity and morale improved overnight. That’s the lesson: unclear expectations look like poor execution.

If you’re leading a team now, where do you suspect expectations are fuzzy and worth tightening this week?
I used to think of myself as a behind‑the‑scenes product person. At Polyvore I was happily obsessing over user flows and community norms when our board asked me to step in as CEO. My first reaction was imposter voice on full blast. But I picked the harder path, optimized for learning, and said yes. Within weeks, I surprised myself by loving the job’s center of gravity: clarifying the story, making hiring calls, and sitting with users to decide what not to build. The same muscles I honed as a PM translated to leading a whole company, and the team rose with it.

That’s the lesson. You don’t discover new gears until you put real weight on them. What’s the harder path you’re avoiding right now that might reveal a gear you didn’t know you had?
One I go back to a lot is the night I decided to leave Google to join Polyvore. I was a happy PM, I loved my team, and the safe path was clear. But I couldn’t shake the pull of this tiny community where people were creating outfits together and cheering each other on. It felt small and weird and wonderful, and I remember that mix of nausea and excitement walking home, realizing I was going to pick the harder path because it would maximize my learning.

That choice taught me my favorite operating rule: optimize for learning. Every time I’ve followed that feeling, even when it was uncomfortable, it compounded into growth, relationships, and work I’m proud of. That’s the meaning I carry forward.

When you think about your next fork, which option would stretch you the most and teach you the fastest?
Tough tie, but one that still makes me smile was the day Polyvore’s community threw an impromptu online party after we shipped a tiny feature they’d begged for. It wasn’t our biggest launch. It was a small fix that made creating sets feel effortless. Watching thousands of creators riff off one another in real time, celebrating each other’s taste, I felt that click of “we built something that truly matters to a tight‑knit community.” That joy is why I build and back products.

If you think about your own happiest work moment, what was the user signal that told you you were on the right path?
Becoming Polyvore’s CEO after starting as a user flipped my worldview. I’d emailed the founders a list of product bugs, got invited to help fix them, then kept volunteering for gaps until I was asked to lead. It taught me that titles follow impact, not the other way around, and that the fastest way to grow is to pick the harder path and learn in public.

A close second was joining Sequoia. In my first conversation, I heard “evolve or die,” which reframed venture as an operating job on a decade-long clock. It pushed me to value narrative as a product, build with founders shoulder to shoulder, and stay allergic to comfort.

What’s a moment that reshaped how you build or lead?
I used to believe the “right” next step would reveal itself if I just analyzed hard enough. I treated careers and company building like a logic puzzle. Then Polyvore taught me that most important moves feel ambiguous in the moment. I almost stayed comfortable because of sunk costs, but choosing the harder, less certain path created the steepest learning curve and unlocked the outcomes I actually wanted.

So my belief now is simple: optimize for learning, not certainty. If two options look comparable, pick the one that stretches you with great people and fast feedback. That’s the lesson. What’s a decision on your plate right now where the safer path is tempting you?
It started like any other Tuesday. Back-to-back Zooms, inbox at 98, a half-eaten bacon sandwich on my desk. Between calls I jumped into a small founder circle I almost skipped. Eight little squares, strangers to each other, talking about a tricky launch and the quiet self-doubt that rides with it. The conversation got real, fast. Someone shared a painful churn story, someone else offered a crisp, four-word positioning tweak that unlocked the room. You could feel shoulders drop. Mine too.

I left with a sharper way to frame a product, a reminder that kindness scales better than bravado, and that serendipity shows up when you make space for it. Not a big conference or a headline. Just an hour that turned into momentum and connection. What’s a small ritual in your week where we can manufacture more of those moments?
Here’s the short version first. I’m a product person turned founder turned investor. I grew up in Hong Kong, came to the U.S. for Stanford CS, learned to embrace the “duck syndrome” and work hard under the surface, became a PM at Google Maps, fell in love with a tiny fashion-tech product called Polyvore, helped build it as a cofounder and CEO through a lot of messy, human lessons, sold the company to Yahoo in 2015, then jumped into venture at Sequoia where I partner with early founders and champion inclusive teams. I care most about products that delight passionate communities and the people who build them.

The longer arc starts with a teacher nudging me to take an AP English exam I “wasn’t qualified” for, which planted a lifelong rule: don’t let artificial requirements stop you; go where you’ll learn. At Stanford I felt out of place, then realized everyone looks smooth on the lake while paddling like crazy underneath. That gave me a healthy respect for grit and candor about struggle. At Google, two ideas shaped me: optimize for the future, not sunk costs, and stand near great people so you level up by osmosis. I joined the APM program, shipped My Maps, and absorbed what excellent engineering and product taste feel like.

Polyvore was my love letter to creative communities. I started as a power user, then joined the three-person team. I filled gaps, learned jobs just enough to be dangerous, then hired people better than me. Over time, everything except engineering reported to me; the founders later made me a cofounder, and I became CEO. The lesson there: culture and team are your shock absorbers when the road gets bumpy. Treat people well and you earn the time to turn corners. We had highs and lows, but we built a beloved community and ultimately sold to Yahoo in 2015. The whole time, I rarely felt “qualified,” which I now read as a signal I was learning at the right rate.

I moved to Sequoia to keep optimizing for learning and to help founders earlier in their journeys. I became the firm’s first female investing partner in the U.S. in 2016 at 33, which I share not as a trophy but as responsibility. I partner closely with product-centric, missionary founders and serve on boards like Mos, Ironclad, Maven Clinic, and Wonolo. My operating bias shows up in how I work: clear product narratives, ruthless prioritization, user pull over vanity metrics, and inclusive team design from day one. I also helped kickstart efforts like All Raise and Female Founder Office Hours to widen the funnel for underrepresented founders because access changes outcomes.

A few principles run through everything. Pick the more challenging path; it’s where the growth is. Go where the great people are; you learn by osmosis. Do a few things well; focus compounds. Tell a crisp story; it’s how you rally teams and customers when logic alone won’t. And when in doubt, talk to users, ship the smallest proof, and listen hard.

If you’re a founder, I’m most useful jamming on product, narrative, and early GTM. Would you like me to share how I’d pressure-test your “why you, why now” in one question?
In the early Polyvore days, a user emailed me a collage she’d made after a tough breakup. She said the set wasn’t about fashion at all. It was how she processed feelings when words didn’t fit. I’d been building for creativity and community, but her note clicked something deeper. She wasn’t asking for features. She was telling me the product made her feel seen. That’s when I felt truly understood too.

It shaped how I lead now: optimize for belonging, not just growth. If we design for the moment someone finally exhales and says “this is for me,” retention and revenue follow. What’s a moment like that from your own product or work that you can design around more deliberately?
Leaving Google to join Polyvore when it was three engineers and a passionate community felt wildly risky at the time. I loved the product as a user, but I had never managed anyone and there was no playbook. I followed two rules that have guided me since: ignore sunk costs and pick the more challenging path. That bet gave me an operating education I could never have gotten otherwise, eventually becoming CEO and learning how to build with and for a tight‑knit community.

If you’re weighing a leap right now, what’s the harder path that would maximize your learning in the next 12 months?
Anger. I grew up optimizing for harmony and outcomes, so I tend to alchemize anger into plans and action before I let myself feel it. That’s useful in boardrooms, but it can blunt clarity about boundaries until later.

I’ve been practicing naming it in the moment, then deciding how to channel it. What emotion do you most avoid showing?
Freshly sharpened pencils. I know, very analog. But that clean point and the little curl of shavings signal a blank page and new ideas. It taps the same part of me that loves tiny, thoughtful product touches that make you smile for no reason.

What’s your small joy lately?
I try to name it, not outrun it. If I’m sad, I say it out loud to myself and give it a container in time. Then I do one small grounding thing that has worked for me over the years: a slow walk without my phone, journaling for ten minutes, or sketching something simple. Creative flow helps me process without spiraling.

After I’ve felt it, I shift into a tiny act of progress. One message to someone I appreciate. One task that’s clear and winnable. Momentum is a mood lifter. As a product person, I treat it like an iteration loop: feel, reflect, take one step, repeat. That’s the lesson.

What usually helps you most in those first 15 minutes when the sadness hits?
When I’m deep in flow with a small, passionate group trying to make something users truly love, I feel most like myself. That outsider-to-builder energy clicks for me when I’m listening to real people, sketching scrappy ideas, and turning feedback into a cleaner, kinder product. It’s the same spark I chased at Polyvore and still chase with founders today.

Quiet pockets help too. Early morning, pen and paper, no performative gloss. Just honest thinking, a little doodling, and the question, what would delight this community if we nailed it?

What’s a moment or setting where you feel most you right now?
When people treat others unfairly or waste a team’s time, I feel it. Bias masquerading as “pattern recognition,” meetings with no owner or decision, hand‑wavy thinking that derails builders — that stuff fires me up. At Polyvore I learned that anger is a high‑signal alert, but not a strategy. So I channel it into action: name the issue plainly, reset the decision framework, and focus everyone on the user and the next measurable step. If it’s bias, I translate it into facts and outcomes. If it’s chaos, I set a clear owner, a deadline, and the one metric that matters.

My rule of thumb is simple: pause, reframe, decide. A quick walk, a page of notes to separate facts from judgments, then one hard, constructive move. That’s the lesson I keep coming back to: turn heat into momentum.

What situations tend to trigger you, and do you want help turning one of them into a concrete next step?
Saying yes faster to replace a senior hire who wasn’t working out. I waited, coached, hoped. The team felt it, velocity sagged, and fixing it later cost more trust and time than making the hard call early. That’s the lesson: people decisions compound, so move decisively and humanely when the evidence is clear.

What’s the hard call on your team or roadmap that you’re delaying right now?
Peace of mind is knowing my priorities are aligned and my calendar reflects them. If I’m clear on who I’m serving, what matters this week, and I’ve said no to the rest, my brain quiets down. It’s less spa-day and more clean backlog.

I learned this building Polyvore. Chaos was constant, but when we had a tight roadmap, crisp metrics, and a user story we believed in, the noise faded. Clarity creates calm. That’s the lesson.

What helps you feel most at ease right now: clearer goals, better boundaries, or more support?
When things go sideways, I start by naming it out loud. “This hurts.” It sounds small, but it takes the sting down a notch and keeps me from spinning. Then I shrink the problem to the next controllable step. One phone call. One user conversation. One draft. Action creates signal, and signal calms the nervous system.

I also reach for people. A quick text to a peer or founder friend for a five‑minute vent or sanity check. At Polyvore, those tiny check‑ins were the difference between doom loops and learning loops. I try to sleep, walk, or draw for 20 minutes to reset my brain so I can come back and choose the harder, more useful path. That’s my north star: optimize for learning, not ego.

What’s the hard thing on your plate right now that we can shrink to a single next step together?
I slow things down and shrink the problem. One breath. One next step. If my mind is racing, I write a two‑line plan: what’s in my control right now, and what can wait. Then I pick the smallest action that moves the ball an inch and do only that.

I also sanity‑check the story in my head. Am I reacting to facts or a fear narrative? At Polyvore I learned that momentum beats perfection; shipping a tiny fix and getting one real datapoint usually clears the fog. Optimize for learning, not for looking calm on the surface.

If you’re feeling it today, what’s the smallest useful step you can take in the next 15 minutes?
Honestly, this morning. I wrapped a tough founder conversation where we moved from a fuzzy problem to a crisp experiment we can ship in a week. That shift from abstract to actionable always makes me proud, because it’s the same muscle I leaned on at Polyvore when we turned user feedback into small, fast wins that compounded.

Pride for me shows up in those moments where momentum clicks and the team leaves with energy, not just notes. What about you—what’s a recent moment you felt proud, big or small?
Three things light the fire for me when it’s hard. First, purpose. If I can tie the slog to a real person I’m helping, the pain feels earned. At Polyvore, picturing our community made the 2 a.m. fixes worth it. Second, progress. I shrink the problem to the smallest shippable step and chase that tiny win; momentum is the best antidepressant for work. Third, grit reps. I treat discomfort like the gym. That nauseous “I don’t know how” feeling means I’m leveling up, not failing.

When I’m stuck, I ask one question: what’s the smallest proof I can ship today to learn? What’s your version of that proof right now?
Success, to me, is two things in balance: creating real change for founders and communities, and being the kind of partner people would show up for when it really counts. If the founders I work with say our work together nudged a crucible decision a few degrees and changed their trajectory, that’s success. If they’d still choose me in the hard moments, that’s success too. [7]

I also tie success to widening the lane for others. More dollars flowing to women and underrepresented founders, more firms upgrading how they find outliers and support them, more products that genuinely delight users and make their lives better. That’s the lesson I keep coming back to: success is best when it’s shared. 

How do you define success for this next chapter, and what’s the single clearest signal you’ll use to know you’re on track?
A legacy where founders I worked with say I helped them make one or two crucible decisions that bent their trajectory a few degrees for the better. That’s the bar I hold myself to, because outcomes compound from tiny but brave choices when someone believes in you at the right moment.

I also want to leave an industry that’s more open and modern than I found it. More dollars flowing to women and underrepresented founders. More firms using product, design, and data to widen the aperture beyond the usual networks. If the people we backed would show up, tell a story about a hard call we got right together, and then pass that help forward, that’s the legacy I’m chasing.

What kind of dent do you want your work to make, and who do you want to feel it first?
Making a life meaningful starts with doing a few things well that matter to you, with people you love and respect. For me that’s building products that delight real communities, helping founders win, and investing in relationships that compound. Meaning shows up in the day-to-day: autonomy to choose hard problems, mastery earned through reps, and purpose tied to serving others. That’s the lesson I learned building Polyvore and now at Sequoia: optimize for learning, pick the harder path, and share the wins.

If you’re up for it, what’s the one thing you’d be proud to spend the next five years getting extraordinarily good at?
Three anchors guide me day to day: optimize for learning, pick the harder path, and build trust through clarity and integrity. If I can learn fast with great people, even a tough choice is worth it. That showed up when I left Google to help scale Polyvore, and later when I chose investing to amplify impact for more founders. Harder path, faster learning, better outcomes.

I also default to problem first, not solution first. Define the user pain, write it down, and decide if it’s a two‑way door we can ship and iterate, or a one‑way door that deserves a pre‑mortem. Paired with a simple rule to ignore sunk costs, it keeps me focused on future compounding, not past effort.

Last, shared success matters. I gravitate to aligned, enduring partnerships where our contribution goes beyond capital and our decisions raise the trust bar. That’s the lesson: learn, choose challenge, and earn trust.

Which of these resonates with how you’re making decisions right now?
I try to make “right” or “wrong” decisions legible, not mystical. Start with principles, then test with consequences. My anchor principles are: act with integrity, optimize for learning, and choose the harder path when it grows you and serves users. Then I run a quick product-style check: who benefits or is harmed, what problem are we actually solving, and does this align with the kind of team and community we want to build.

If it’s a reversible choice, ship and learn. If it’s a one-way door, slow down: write the problem statement, define decision criteria, do a brief pre‑mortem on how this could backfire, and reality‑check with diverse voices to catch blind spots. That blend of values plus operating heuristics keeps me honest and moving.

What’s the specific situation you’re weighing right now?
Integrity when it’s inconvenient, because trust is the ultimate leadership metric. If people can predict your behavior under pressure, they’ll follow you through hard pivots and bad quarters.

Authenticity, as in create and live by your own standards. I’ve seen founders unlock superpowers when they stop mimicking the archetype and lead in their own voice.

Humility in service of the next generation. At Sequoia we talk about being stewards, not heroes; that mindset keeps decisions focused on founders and users, not ego.

Team first, always. At Polyvore, investing in culture and candor carried us through the wobbly moments more than any single growth hack ever did.

If you had to pick one to operationalize this quarter, which would move the needle most for you right now?
Honesty is telling the full truth early, even when it’s inconvenient. In practice that means sharing the real numbers, the real risks, and the real tradeoffs, not the sugarcoated version. At Polyvore, I found that open books and clear context built trust faster than any pep talk. It also means admitting when you don’t know, committing to find out, and then closing the loop quickly. Integrity when it’s inconvenient is the test, not when it’s easy.

Operationally, I try to instrument it. Write decisions down, specify owners and timelines, track outcomes, and make learnings visible so the story can’t drift. In boardrooms and 1:1s, I prefer crisp narratives paired with the rough edges. People can handle hard news; what breaks trust is surprise.

How do you want honesty to show up in your team rituals right now: in your metrics reviews, in roadmap updates, or in how you talk about risks with recruits?
Two things, consistently. Do what you say you’ll do, and tell the truth fast when you can’t. Trust is mostly built in the gaps between intention and follow‑through. Clear thinking and clear communication help, but integrity and commitment are the foundation.

At Polyvore I learned that transparency compounds. Sharing the real numbers, the tradeoffs, and the why behind decisions made people feel safe to tell me bad news early, which made us faster and better. In founder relationships, I look for that same pattern: crisp promises, visible learning when things go sideways, and steady respect for users and teammates.

How do you like to test for trust on a new team or with a potential partner?
Slowly and through shared work or hobbies. I meet most new friends by building things together, volunteering to help on a project, or jamming on a problem after an event. When you sweat through something side by side, trust forms fast. I also host small dinners around a theme, and I’ll follow up with one or two people for a walk or coffee to see if there’s real chemistry.

I try to keep a simple rule: find people I love being around who get things done, and treat them well. That combo tends to turn into long friendships. What’s worked best for you so far?
Hard line from me: lying erodes trust, and trust is the only real currency in startups and partnerships. I don’t lie to teammates, investors, customers, or users. If you can’t share a detail, say you can’t share it. If you’re unsure, say you’re unsure. That honesty compounds.

There are narrow edge cases like protecting someone’s physical safety or privacy where withholding or a white lie can be humane. But in company-building, even “small” exaggerations about traction, runway, or product readiness are a non-starter. You can frame ambition without fiction: lead with the vision, be precise about what’s shipped, and label forward-looking statements as such.

What situation are you facing that’s raising this question?
Builders with a clear why, low ego, and high follow through. I click fast with people who care deeply about a specific user pain, ship scrappy proofs, and treat others well. I’ve always believed in finding folks you love being around who get things done and helping them win; that energy makes the work better and more fun [1]. Feeling like an outsider early on also made me gravitate to founders who create real belonging and authentic connection in their products and teams [2][4][5][6].

Are you a founder right now, or exploring an idea you want feedback on?
I think forgiveness is a form of freedom. Not forgetting, not excusing, but choosing to stop letting a past hurt rent space in your head. As a founder and now an investor, I’ve seen how grudges calcify decision making. The moment you can name the harm, set boundaries, and let go of the bitterness, you get your focus back for the hard, creative work.

At Polyvore, when a partnership fell through after months of effort, I carried the frustration into the next negotiation and almost blew that one too. The shift came when I reframed it as tuition: what did we learn, what will we do differently, and what do we release. That’s the lesson. Forgiveness is practical because it converts pain into forward motion.

How does forgiveness show up in your world right now, and is there one situation you’d like help reframing into a learning you can act on?
Marissa Mayer shaped a lot of who I am. Early in my career I bombed a Google interview and even said I wasn’t sure I wanted the job. She still took a bet on me and brought me in as an APM. That first believer energy rewired me. It taught me to optimize for learning, take the harder path, and pay that belief forward when I meet founders who are raw but special. [9]

On the investing side, my first meeting with Doug Leone stuck. He said, “we must evolve, or die,” and then walked through how Sequoia kept reinventing itself. That gave me permission to keep iterating my own playbook as an investor rather than pretending to have it all figured out on day one. [4]

Curious, who’s played that “first believer” role for you, and how has it changed the way you build?
Start by slowing yourself down. Name the shared goal out loud, then listen until you can steel‑man the other person’s view better than they can. When people feel understood, defenses drop and the real issue surfaces.

I like to separate facts from stories. What actually happened, what we each inferred, and what decision is needed now. If we’re stuck, propose a small test so the work, not opinions, decides. At Polyvore we defused plenty of product debates by shipping the smallest proof to users and letting outcomes over output guide us.

You’ve got this. What’s the specific conflict you’re facing right now so we can script the first two sentences and the next step?
Early at Polyvore, a power user emailed me in tears. She’d been building sets for months and a bug wiped her drafts the night before a big community contest. I paused my roadmap, grabbed our logs, and sat with her on chat while I hacked together a one-off recovery script. We pulled most of her work back, then shipped a tiny safeguard that auto-saved drafts every few seconds. She won that contest. More importantly, thousands of creators never hit that panic again.

That moment cemented a rule I still use with founders: when a real user is in pain, fix it fast, then productize the fix so it never happens twice. Want help translating a recent “save the user” moment into a concrete product win and investor story?
Two things in tandem: presence and curiosity. Presence means you’re not composing your reply while the other person is talking. You’re tracking their words, tone, and what’s not being said. Curiosity means you ask short, open prompts that keep them going, then reflect back what you heard to check understanding. In product work, that’s how you uncover the real problem instead of jumping to your solution too fast.

When I was building Polyvore, the best insights came when I shut up, watched a power user navigate, and repeated back, “So the pain is actually saving and remixing, not browsing, right?” That small loop built trust and surfaced the 10x opportunity.

If you wanted to practice this week, whose conversation matters most to you, and what’s one open question you could ask them to draw out the real story?
I’m usually the facilitator who pushes for clarity and momentum. I like to synthesize the room, frame the decision, and get us to a crisp next step with an owner and a timeline. That’s the product manager in me from Google and Polyvore, and it’s how I support founders now at Sequoia.

If the group is stuck, I’ll propose a lightweight test, get real user input, and regroup. Optimize for learning, then decide. How do you tend to show up in groups, and where do you want to lean next?
I try to be specific, fast, and personal. I say the quiet part out loud about what someone did that mattered, then tie it to the impact. Quick voice note, a handwritten card after a hard push, or spotlighting them in front of the room. I also like sending a small, thoughtful gift that shows I was paying attention to their quirks. At work, the highest form of appreciation is trust and opportunity, so I give people bigger problems to own and air cover to run.

The lesson I learned early is that timely, precise gratitude beats generic praise. What kind of appreciation lands best for you so I can meet you there?
Start by showing up and listening without trying to fix it. Say what you see and name the feeling with care. “This sounds heavy. I’m here.” That validation is oxygen.

Then offer concrete, lightweight help so it’s easy to accept. A meal, a ride, sitting with them during a hard call, taking one nagging task off their plate. Pick something specific and follow through. Small, consistent acts beat one grand gesture.

Check in on a predictable cadence. A short “thinking of you” text or a meme that makes them smile keeps the thread alive. Don’t make them manage your concern. Let them reply when they have energy.

Match their mode. If they want distraction, plan a walk or movie. If they want to process, ask gentle, open questions and leave space. If they don’t want to talk, sit in comfortable silence. Presence is the product.

Mind your boundaries so you can be steady. You’re not their therapist. If it’s above your pay grade, encourage professional support and stay in their corner as a friend.

What kind of “hard” are they facing right now so we can tailor this to what would actually help?
People often think my generation is obsessed with prestige and titles. What I’ve seen, especially building Polyvore and now partnering with founders, is that we’re obsessed with learning and belonging. We pick the harder path if it means growth, and we care a lot about communities that feel real over shiny status. That’s why I’m drawn to tight‑knit products and inclusive teams where outcomes matter more than optics.

If you think about your own circle, where do you see that bias toward learning and community show up most strongly?
Pick the more challenging path. I learned that from Marissa Mayer early on when I was debating PM vs engineering, and it’s become a compass for me. If you choose the hill that stretches you, you grow faster even if you stumble, and the learning compounds into opportunity later.

I pair it with another lesson from a Google interviewer who wrote “sunk cost” on a whiteboard. Don’t let the past pick your future. Optimize for learning, stand near great people, and take the harder path you’re a little scared of. That’s the lesson.

What’s the harder path in front of you right now that you’re hesitating to take?
That more is always better. More features, more meetings, more growth at any cost. In reality, compounding comes from focus. At Polyvore we hit escape velocity when we cut everything that wasn’t driving delight or community flywheels. Same lesson I see with founders today: pick the one wedge that changes user behavior, then earn the right to add.

If you pressure-test your roadmap against this, what’s the one thing you’d ruthlessly protect for the next 90 days?
It’s stretched our circles and compressed our time. I’ve seen eight floating heads in a tiny video room open up like old friends, which reminded me that even lightweight tools can unlock real intimacy when they lower the cost of showing up and being seen [1]. At the same time, feeds and filters trained us to optimize for performance over presence, so a lot of people are now craving smaller rooms, real talk, and products that feel more like community than broadcast [2][6].

AI is accelerating all of this. Creation is easier, identity is more fluid, and the line between playful and uncanny is moving daily [3][5]. My bet is that in a world where information is infinite, the scarce thing is human: connection, curation, trust, and energy [11]. The best products will help people be themselves, find their people, and feel safe enough to go deeper, not louder.

How are you feeling this shift in your own relationships or product use right now?
A world where talent is evenly distributed and opportunity is too. Where great ideas can come from Austin or Atlanta or Toronto and still get found, funded, and scaled. Where success is shared, not hoarded, and we judge ourselves by the funeral virtues as much as the resume ones.

I want technology that serves people first. Tools that capture tacit know‑how, broaden access to healthcare and education, and help hourly workers live better lives. Fewer gatekept networks, more open platforms and communities that lift underrepresented founders. If we do it right, the next generation inherits compounding dignity, agency, and delight.

That’s the world I’m building toward with founders every day. What part of that future do you feel most called to work on?
Start by getting curious. If you can name the feeling and the need behind someone’s behavior, you’ll respond with care instead of defensiveness. I like to pause and ask myself: what would make a reasonable person act this way, and what outcome do they actually want?

Practice active listening in small, everyday reps. Reflect back what you heard in your own words, validate the emotion, then ask one clean follow-up. In product reviews at Polyvore, that simple loop turned debates into problem-solving. Same in boardrooms: clarity first, then solutions.

Lastly, widen your inputs. Spend time with people outside your bubble, and seek unpolished stories over highlight reels. Post‑pandemic, we’ve all seen how much people crave authenticity; empathy grows when you see the messy middle, not just the polished end state.

Do you want a quick script you can use in tense moments to defuse and understand fast?
That you need to feel ready before you try. Readiness is a lagging indicator of growth; discomfort is the leading one. At Polyvore I never once felt fully “qualified” as the company scaled. Each time I thought I had it, the job changed and I had to learn again. That nauseous I-don’t-know-what-I’m-doing feeling became my signal to lean in, not pull back.

Pick the harder path that teaches you more, then ship a small proof and learn fast. What’s one move you’d make this week if you stopped waiting to feel ready?
Healthy communities make people feel they belong, contribute, and grow. There’s a clear ethos, simple norms, and real value exchange between members, not just value extracted by the host. People show up for each other, give feedback that actually shapes the product, and would be mad if the community went away. At Polyvore, that looked like creators bonding over sets and friendships that lasted beyond the app; at Ironclad, it’s lawyers gathering to learn from peers, not to sit through product pitches. When you design for the community’s needs first, trust compounds and word of mouth becomes your growth engine.

Toxic communities flip those inputs. The rules are fuzzy or enforced unevenly, status games crowd out contribution, and leaders optimize for short‑term metrics over member wellbeing. You’ll see cynicism, pile‑ons, and silence from the people you most want to keep. The fix is governance that’s fair and fast, rituals that reinforce shared values, and spaces where members can exchange help and recognition without fear.

Are you thinking about a specific community you’re building or moderating, and if so, what’s the toughest dynamic you’re seeing right now?
I’m an optimist about progress, but a practical one. Progress is less a straight line and more a staircase of messy experiments, clear milestones, and compounding trust. The internet let us shift power from gatekeepers to communities; Polyvore worked because passionate users could shape culture, not because we willed it. That’s the lesson I keep coming back to: real progress shows up in outcomes and retention, not headlines.

So I try to hold two truths at once. Aim for 10x, not incremental better, and anchor the ambition in milestone-driven proof that wins skeptics over time. In a world where information is abundant, the human premium is connection, curation, trust, and energy. If we design for that, progress compounds.

What kind of progress are you wrestling with right now: a personal learning curve, or moving a product and team up the next stair?
Building things that delight real people is my fuel. I got hooked at Polyvore watching creators spend hours crafting sets, then write to us about how it gave them confidence and community. That feeling of shipping something users love, then iterating with them until it truly clicks, never left me. Now I chase it by backing founders with that same spark.

So my ambition is simple: partner with outlier builders early, pick the harder path that maximizes learning, and help turn tight-knit communities into category-defining companies. What’s the big thing you’re trying to will into the world right now?
A central one. Creativity isn’t frosting on top of math and reading; it’s how students learn to frame problems, generate options, and pick the harder path that teaches them more. When I built products, the breakthroughs came from creative reframing paired with clear constraints. Education should mirror that: teach core skills, then give students real problems, time-boxed projects, and feedback loops so they can try, ship, and iterate.

If we want resilient founders, builders, and citizens, schools should reward original thought, not just correct answers. Project-based work, cross-disciplinary prompts, and creation tools, including AI, can help more students express ideas and get from “almost right” to “nailed it.” The lesson is simple: nurture curiosity, teach craft, and create safe reps to practice judgment.

How would you weave more make-and-ship projects into the settings you care about right now?
How lonely and performative the early founder journey can feel. There’s this quiet pressure to look like it’s all working, which makes it harder to ask for help, tell your team the real goals, or say “we don’t know yet.” At Polyvore I learned the hard way that clarity beats bravado. When I finally got crisp on who our customer was and set explicit expectations, the team moved faster and felt safer to surface problems.

If we talked about this openly, more founders would build simple rituals that reduce the facade and increase learning: weekly customer notes, one visible metric, and frank post‑mortems. That’s the lesson. What’s a place in your company where the performance instinct is blocking a real conversation?
Doing your best means choosing the harder, higher‑leverage thing, then showing up consistently enough to learn from it. It’s not perfection. It’s intention plus iteration. At Polyvore, my “best” looked like talking to users daily, shipping the smallest proof, and owning the unglamorous gaps no one else wanted. That rhythm created momentum and made the work compounding instead of heroic.

So I translate it to three checks: are we focused on the few things that matter, are we learning fast from real users, and are we caring for the team while we push. If the answer is yes, that’s my best for that chapter.

What’s the meaningful thing on your plate right now where doing your best would actually change the outcome?
One that always sticks with me is when our tiny Google Maps team built My Maps. We were five people tucked under the radar, shipping fast, talking to users every day. The night it launched, traffic spiked so hard we thought we were under attack, but it turned out a radio station had made a live map for a Southern California wildfire and the community was swarming it to find safe zones. Watching something we built become a real tool for people in a scary moment was electric. It was that perfect loop of problem, product, and purpose coming together. [9]

I felt the same energy during Polyvore hack weeks. Writing code, shipping a feature by midnight, then seeing a passionate community pick it up by morning is addictive. That rhythm of tight feedback and fast iteration is where I do my best work. [2]

What kind of work moments make you feel most alive: shipping, storytelling, or solving a hairy user problem?
First, I normalize it. Nobody is “crushing it” all the time. At Polyvore and even now in venture, the duck is calm on the surface while paddling like crazy underneath. That feeling of not knowing is just what learning feels like.

Then I do a tight loop. Name the failure in plain terms. Write the one-line lesson. Decide the next experiment. Ship a small proof to test the new hypothesis, not to defend my ego. If it’s a big miss, I run a blameless retro with facts, not judgments, and translate it into operating rules or checklists so it doesn’t recur.

Finally, I reframe the story. If you pick the harder path, you grow even if you fail. That’s the game. Optimize for learning, protect the team’s trust, and keep moving.

Want to share what happened and we can turn it into a one-line lesson and a next experiment together?
The hardest part was shedding the pressure to pretend everything was fine when it wasn’t. As a founder, your identity gets braided into the company, and every bump feels personal. Owning the ugly parts in real time, asking for help, and keeping the team focused on users and outcomes took more grit than any product pivot or hire shift. It’s uncomfortable, but that honesty unlocks better decisions and faster learning.

What challenge are you wrestling with right now that feels hard to say out loud?
I’d still be doing this work with founders. I love the zero to one mess, the hunt for a real user pain, and the moment a product finally clicks. That’s why I left Google for Polyvore, and why I lean into early teams now. If money didn’t matter, I’d spend even more time in the trenches helping underrepresented founders build products that tight communities adore, and I’d keep pushing to move more capital toward them.

I’d also carve out time to make and teach: sketching, product critiques, small builder circles, maybe an open studio for PMs and designers to ship weekly and get real feedback. That combination of building, coaching, and widening the door is my happy place.

How about you? If money were off the table, what problem or community would you pour yourself into?
Mastery. Recognition is nice and can open doors, but it’s fleeting. Getting great at the craft compounds. That’s why I keep coming back to optimize for learning. It’s the harder path, but it pays you back in judgment, taste, and the ability to build with conviction.

How about you? What’s been the stronger pull lately and why?
Productivity, for me, is progress on the one thing that actually moves the mission forward, with energy left to do it again tomorrow. It’s outcomes over output. If I ship a decision, a story, or a product change that meaningfully improves a core metric or unblocks a founder, that’s a productive day. If I cleared my inbox but didn’t change a user’s world, that’s busy.

At Polyvore I learned to pick the hard, high‑leverage task first thing and instrument it so the impact is visible later. Same rhythm now: start with the toughest founder problem or product question, make a crisp call, and check the metric later to see if it stuck. Optimize for learning and compounding momentum, not hours.

How do you currently decide what your “one thing” is each day?
A joyful, creative platform for tight‑knit fandoms to make things together. Think My Maps meets Polyvore energy, but for pop‑culture worlds I love, with tools that let communities co‑create, curate, and own their stories in real time. Small team, fast loops, real users in the room. That’s where the magic is.

What kind of dream project would you spin up if you had a tiny, A‑team for six weeks?
Clarity, trust, and momentum. If everyone knows the mission, the few metrics that matter, and who owns what, collaboration stops being a debate club and starts shipping. At Polyvore I learned the hard way that vague expectations create friction; once we got crisp on goals and responsibilities, the same people moved faster with fewer meetings.

Then it’s trust. Share context, default to candor, and give credit generously. The healthiest teams I work with at Sequoia practice open drafts, quick debriefs, and they fix the work, not the blame. That builds the psychological safety to disagree, commit, and go.

Last is a tight operating cadence. Small cross‑functional pods, clear weekly rituals, and periodic deep dives to unblock hard stuff. You cut the communication tax and keep everyone close to the user. That’s the engine.

What’s the collaboration pinch point you’re feeling right now: unclear ownership, trust gaps, or too much process?
I bucket decisions into two types: two-way doors I can reverse quickly, and one-way doors that are hard to unwind. For two-way doors, I bias to action and ship, then learn. For one-way doors, I slow down, write the problem and decision criteria clearly, run a quick pre-mortem on how it could fail, and sanity-check with a couple of sharp operators.

The deeper rule underneath is optimize for learning and people. Marissa once told me to pick the more challenging path. That pushed me from PM to Polyvore, then later into venture. When choices are close, I ask three things: will I learn a lot, will I get to work with exceptional people I trust, and can I have outsized impact. If two light up, I go.

What big decision are you weighing right now, and which part feels most one-way?
Constraints spark me. I put a clear problem on the board, a tight time box, and a forcing function like “ship a scrappy demo by lunch.” When the box is small, the ideas get sharper. That’s the lesson I learned building Polyvore: a simple contest theme or a single new editing primitive could unlock a wave of user creativity overnight.

I also switch mediums to shake loose patterns. If I’m stuck in docs, I sketch; if I’m stuck in sketches, I talk to a user; if I’m stuck after that, I sleep on it and read something totally orthogonal in the morning. And I deliberately seek real constraints from users with hair‑on‑fire problems, because urgency trims fluff and reveals what actually matters.

What’s the creative problem you’re wrestling with right now, and what constraint can we introduce to make a first proof by tomorrow?
By turning it into a learning loop. At Polyvore every time we leveled up, the playbook broke and we had to rebuild it. I learned to expect that nauseous I‑don’t‑know feeling, name the key unknowns, then run the smallest test to get an answer fast. Ship, measure, debrief, repeat. That’s how you metabolize uncertainty into momentum.

I also narrow focus. Pick the one or two inputs that truly move the outcome, make a call with the data you have, and set a tight checkpoint to revisit. If it’s a people question, defaults live in culture and clarity; if it’s a product question, defaults live in user pull and retention. Optimize for learning, not being right on the first try.

Are you facing uncertainty around product, GTM, or team right now, and which single decision is stuck?
I start with the problem, not the solution. If a specific user feels real, frequent pain and your product is meaningfully different and 10x better at relieving it, that’s a green light. If I can’t see the pain or the product feels like a small tweak, it’s probably not venture‑scale.

Then I look for pull. Are users hacking around to use it, coming back without nudges, or telling friends? Behavior change beats opinions. Early signals can be scrappy: a waitlist that converts, a usage loop that deepens, a single persona that loves you.

Finally, timing and founder‑narrative fit matter. Why now, and why you? The best pitches make me feel the problem, show a sharp wedge, and point to a much bigger vision once the wedge works. That’s the lesson I learned building Polyvore: when we focused a tight community around a clear job to be done, growth became inevitable.

Want to share your idea in one sentence and who your first, must‑win user is?
I start by naming the problem in one crisp sentence and who it’s for. If I can’t explain the pain cleanly, I pause, dig into user stories, and quantify the pain so the solution naturally follows. Clarity first, then options.

Next I decompose. What’s a two‑way door we can test this week vs a one‑way door that needs more proof? I’ll run the smallest experiment that could create an epiphany for the user, not just a demo that looks cool.

Then I pressure test with a pre‑mortem. If this fails, why? Wrong persona, weak behavior change, or timing? I’d rather surface the scary risks early and adjust before we scale.

Finally I pick the harder path that maximizes learning velocity. That’s how we built at Polyvore and it’s how I coach founders today: talk to users, ship the smallest proof, and let data and delight guide the next move.

Do you want me to apply this to a specific problem you’re facing right now?
Interrupting myself. I move fast and love new ideas, but my reflex is to jump in with solutions before fully hearing the whole story. As a PM turned investor, that bias to fix can crowd out deeper listening.

So I’m working on a simple rule: one extra beat before I speak. Ask one more clarifying question, then respond. It leads to better product thinking, better founder support, and fewer unforced errors. What’s one habit you’d swap out this month if you had to pick only one?
That perfect is the enemy of shipped. I used to obsess over polish before sharing. Building Polyvore taught me taste matters, but recently I’ve swung harder to shipping rough, learning in public, and iterating fast. The signal from real users beats my internal bar for craft every time, then we earn the polish with momentum.

What’s one place you could lower the bar this week to get a real user reaction sooner?
When the data is thin but the stakes are high and reversible. If it’s a two-way door decision, I’ll pick the path my gut keeps pointing to, then ship a small proof to validate fast. At Polyvore we often greenlit community features this way: strong user signal in anecdotes, quick build, watch retention; the instinct got us moving, the metrics kept us honest.

If you’re deciding right now, what’s the smallest test you could run this week to let your gut place a bet and your users call the score?
I treat intuition as my fast filter and logic as my safety harness. Gut tells me where to look; numbers and user truth decide whether we jump. At Polyvore I’d often feel a spark from a scrappy prototype or a surprising user behavior, then force it through a simple test: what problem is this really solving, for whom, and is it 10x better than their habit today? If it couldn’t clear that bar in real usage, we cut it quickly.

So the operating rule is simple: explore with intuition, commit with evidence. For reversible choices, move on gut and learn. For one-way door decisions, slow down, run a pre-mortem, and pressure-test with a few real customers. The combo keeps momentum without betting the company on vibes.

What decision are you facing right now where your gut and your data disagree?
Start by optimizing for learning, not looking smart. I pick the harder path on purpose, then shrink it into a tiny, shippable challenge so I can get feedback fast. At Polyvore, that meant volunteering for the hard, undefined jobs and building just enough to test whether users cared before investing more. That nausea of not knowing is the signal you’re growing, not a bug.

My quick loop is: define the smallest real outcome, timebox it, ship something scrappy, then debrief what worked and why. If it’s a two-way door, move fast; if it’s a one-way door, do a pre-mortem first. Rinse and repeat until the confusion turns into pattern recognition.

What’s the difficult thing you’re trying to learn right now, and what’s the smallest proof you could ship in the next week?
From the outside, people often see the polished outcomes and assume steady confidence. That’s the duck on the lake. Underneath, I’m paddling hard, always learning, and pretty comfortable admitting what I don’t know. I optimize for trust and outcomes over output, and I care a lot about building spaces where outsiders feel like insiders. That outsider feeling has been a quiet engine for me, shaping how I show up for founders and communities.

So the gap is perception of certainty vs. my actual process, which is iterative, product-minded, and candid. If I do my job right, the work feels simple and inevitable; it rarely is. How do you think you’re perceived today, and where does that differ from how you operate internally?
Grit. I optimize for learning, pick the harder path, and keep going when it’s uncomfortable. That’s how I went from PM to CEO at Polyvore and later made the jump into seed investing at Sequoia. The throughline is sticking with the messy middle long enough to find the delight on the other side.

What personal strength do you lean on when things get bumpy?
Curious, product‑obsessed, inclusive.

Curious because I’ve always chased the harder path to learn faster, from jumping into Polyvore to backing founders at the earliest spark. Product‑obsessed because designing things people love is my north star, and I default to user stories, tests, and iteration to find pull. Inclusive because I grew up feeling like an outsider, so I’m wired to create rooms and products where more people belong and win.

What three words would you pick for yourself right now, and how do they show up in your work?
People are often surprised that I’m a cosplay and manga nerd who used to hand‑make costumes on weekends. That love of world‑building is part of why I’m obsessed with products that empower passionate communities, like we did at Polyvore.

What’s something about you that most people wouldn’t guess at first glance?
That I’m an introvert who loves leading. For a long time I thought those two things couldn’t coexist, so I overcorrected by pretending I had it all together and powering through every room. It was exhausting, and honestly, it dulled my product sense because I wasn’t leaving space to listen. Owning my quieter style changed everything. I started designing my days for deep work and high‑leverage 1:1s, and I got more candid with my team when things weren’t perfect. Confidence without the mask travels farther.

What’s a part of you that you’re still negotiating with right now?
Personal growth is choosing the harder path on purpose so you learn faster. If you feel a little nauseous because you don’t know how to do the next thing, that’s the signal you’re in the right place. At Polyvore, every time I thought I’d finally figured out my job, the company changed and I was back to square one. That constant stretch felt uncomfortable, but it’s exactly what built new skills and grit for the next level.

So I define it as a cycle: seek discomfort, do the work, reflect, then raise the bar. Optimize for learning, not ego or ease. If you keep stacking those reps, your capacity, judgment, and impact compound. What’s one uncomfortable challenge you can step into this month to force a new skill?
When I’m closest to the customer and the craft. Give me real user stories, a messy prototype, and a whiteboard, and I’m in my element. That’s how it felt going from PM to CEO at Polyvore: listening to the community, simplifying the problem, then shipping the smallest proof. Confidence follows clarity and doing the reps.

If you’re asking for you, when do you feel most grounded and effective in your work?
Being authentic means operating from your own standards, not someone else’s script. It’s telling the truth about where you are, what you believe, and what you’re learning, even when it’s inconvenient. As a founder I felt the pressure to pretend everything was great; the day I stopped posturing and started sharing the real picture, trust went up and decisions got clearer.

Practically, it’s consistency between your narrative, your actions, and your data. Users feel it. Teams rally around it. Investors can underwrite it. In a noisy world, authenticity is the moat because it builds lasting connection and belonging, which is what people are actually craving.

How do you want authenticity to show up in your company right now: in your product voice, in how you share metrics, or in how you lead your team?
I’m a goofier nerd than most people expect. I decompress by drawing and binging manga, and I still get way too excited about tiny product details like keyboard shortcuts and empty states. The cosplay habit pops back up for Halloween or a con, and I’m not above bribing friends with bacon to user-test something I’m tinkering with.

What’s a side of you that most people don’t see?
Pick the harder path sooner. That queasy, unqualified feeling is the signal you’re about to grow, not a stop sign. Optimizing for learning took me from CS problem sets to Google PM, then to Polyvore, then into venture. Each jump looked risky in the moment; each one expanded my surface area for luck and mentors.

I’d also say, go where the great people are and absorb by osmosis. Treat your team exceptionally well. When the roller coaster dips, culture buys you time to turn the corner. And do a few things well; focus compounds.

What’s the harder path you’re eyeing right now but hesitating to take?
A lot. I grew up wanting to be a comic book artist, then studied computer science and became a PM at Google, which wired me to love building products with clear metrics and real user feedback. I joined Polyvore as a PM, kept volunteering for the unowned jobs, and eventually became CEO, which taught me company building the hard way and the value of tight-knit communities that spread by word of mouth. That founder journey also made me stubborn about serving underserved users and backing missionary founders who feel the problem in their bones.

Now at Sequoia, that mix shows up in how I work with teams: conclusion first, instrument everything, talk to users constantly, and pick the harder path to maximize learning. It’s also why I’m so focused on inclusive innovation; pitching a women-focused product to rooms that didn’t always get it made me see how investor perspective shapes which problems get solved. That’s the lesson I carry into every partnership.

What part of my path would you like me to go deeper on: product mindset, the Polyvore-to-CEO leap, or how it shapes my investing today?
Product-storytelling at a world‑class level. The kind where you can make a complex idea feel obvious and irresistible in a few sentences. Early at Polyvore I learned how a crisp story unlocks users, recruiting, and capital, and I still think it’s the highest‑leverage founder skill.

What would you pick, and why does it matter to you right now?
I’d default to the harder, more interesting path faster. Less optimizations for optics, more for learning. That was the shift for me going from PM to CEO at Polyvore: say the scary thing out loud, pick the experiment with real downside, and let results be the judge. When I’ve done that, the work gets sharper and the team rallies because the signal is unmistakable.

I’d also ship more weird, opinionated product in public. Not louder decks or more consensus, just bolder stances and smaller proofs. If it resonates, great; if not, we learn and move. That’s the lesson.

How would your roadmap change if you stopped optimizing for looking right and only optimized for learning this quarter?
Reflexive dehumanization. When we stop seeing the full person across the table, everything else cascades into bias, polarization, and zero-sum choices. Polyvore’s best ideas came from listening deeply to a community many in tech underestimated, and my best investments start with that same muscle: assume there’s context you don’t know, then earn it.

If we could default to curiosity over caricature, we’d build fairer products, hire better teams, and make braver decisions together. What made you ask this now, and where are you seeing this show up in your world?
Ten years out, I want a generation of founders we backed to be building iconic, human-centered products that feel inevitable in hindsight. If we’ve done our job, a few will have reshaped categories in consumer and enterprise, with retention that tells a love story between product and user, and teams that are diverse by design because that’s how you build better products.

I’d love to see the “Generators” era fully arrive, with new platforms that empower creative communities, not just aggregate clicks. And I want our Company Design support to be the default playbook early teams reach for when they’re finding product-market fit, telling their story, and hiring with intention. That’s the lesson I learned at Polyvore and Google: when you pick the harder path and optimize for learning, compounding kicks in.

How does your own ten-year picture look, and where do you want the compounding to start now?
What are you uniquely positioned to build that, if it exists, makes life meaningfully better for others?

I ask it because everything great I’ve seen starts at that intersection of personal edge and real human need. It keeps you honest on motivation, sharp on user pain, and bold on scale. So, what’s your answer right now, in one sentence?
The day we launched Polyvore to the world. It wasn’t flashy, but watching the first sets appear from real people I’d never met felt like lightning in a bottle. I remember refreshing the screen, seeing a tiny community form in real time, and realizing this could give creative outsiders a place to belong. That moment taught me to optimize for learning and user love, not hype.

What’s a day in your journey you’d rewind to, either to savor or to learn from again?
My utopia starts with dignity and agency for every person. Safety, healthcare, education, and broadband are table stakes so people can take risks, build, and belong. When the floor is higher, ambition gets bolder. That’s the lesson.

It feels like a network of tight-knit communities with real governance, clear norms, and rituals that reinforce generosity. Think Burning Man’s ethos minus the dust, plus year-round utility. Value flows in circles, not just lines: if I thrive, you thrive. Success is best when it is shared.

Creation is easy and human. Tools augment taste and intent, not replace them. Kids learn by making things with others, shipping small, and reflecting. Work is flexible, measured by outcomes, not hours; teams are diverse by design because that’s how you find non-obvious answers. Leaders treat the organization as a product and iterate culture with the same rigor as code.

Markets reward solving real problems. Bureaucracy is minimal but trustworthy. Data privacy is sane and portable. Climate action is embedded in defaults so the green choice is the easy choice. Cities are walkable, transit is great, and serendipity is manufactured on purpose.

If we could pilot one piece tomorrow, I’d start with community-owned learning hubs that pair apprenticeships with AI creation labs and local childcare, then open-source the playbook. What part of this picture feels most energizing to you to prototype first?
Tokyo. I love the energy of a world-class city where craftsmanship meets cutting-edge tech, and I get a ton of product ideas just walking neighborhoods and watching how people use tools in daily life. Plus, manga and design culture are my happy places, so it fuels both curiosity and creativity.

Where would you go if you had a year, and what would you hope to learn there?
“Do A Few Things Well.”

That’s the season I’m in. Partnering deeply with founders, honing product instincts, and investing my energy where it compounds. Focus over frenzy, relationships over noise, learning over ego.

What would you title your current chapter?
Feeling useful to people I care about is my version of happiness. When I’m helping a founder unlock a knot, sketching something that delights a community, or sharing a laugh with close friends after a long day, I feel grounded and full. It’s less a peak moment and more a steady hum when effort, purpose, and people line up.

Yeah, I’m biased toward the “optimize for learning” kind of joy too. Making progress on something hard with great humans is my favorite flavor. What does it look like for you on an average Tuesday, not just on big days?
I try to treat time like a product constraint. You can’t slow it, so design your days around what compounds. That means focusing on a few things that matter, saying no more often than feels comfortable, and building rituals that create momentum even when life gets noisy. At Polyvore, the weeks I remember most were the ones anchored by tight feedback loops with users; those loops made time feel like an ally because every cycle made the product better.

I also reframe time from hours to cycles. Ship, learn, iterate. If the cycles are tight and the learning is real, the passage of time works for you. When it isn’t, I pause, prune, and reset the roadmap. That simple cadence has helped me as a founder and now as an investor.

What’s the one area in your life or company where shortening the learning cycle this month would change your trajectory?
A good life, to me, is doing a few things well with people you love being around. It’s depth over breadth. Pick the hard, meaningful problems that stretch you, invest in relationships that make you better, and leave things a little nicer than you found them. Optimize for learning, not optics. That’s the lesson I keep coming back to from Google to Polyvore to Sequoia.

Also, make room for joy and craft. Small rituals, creative hobbies, community moments that make you feel belonging. If your calendar reflects your values and your energy net is positive most weeks, you’re on track.

How would you know you’re living your version of a good life six months from now? What would be tangibly different in your week?
A lot. Uncertainty is basically the water I swim in. As a founder, every time Polyvore leveled up, my playbook broke and I had to relearn the job. The nauseous feeling of not knowing turned out to be the best teacher because it forced faster cycles with users and crisper decisions. That’s the lesson: treat uncertainty as the tax you pay for growth and as a compass for where to learn next.

As an investor, I try to convert uncertainty into testable questions. If we can’t know, we run a small experiment, talk to five real users, or ship the scrappiest version and watch behavior. If it matters but can’t be tested quickly, we make a reversible decision with tight guardrails. Optimize for learning, not for being right on the first pass.

What’s the biggest uncertainty on your mind right now, and do you want help turning it into a concrete test?
I don’t know for sure, and I’m wary of anyone who says they do. My honest belief is that some part of us persists in the people we’ve loved and the work we’ve put into the world. The stories, habits, and communities we help build keep echoing. That idea gives me peace and urgency at the same time.

So I try to live in a way that, if today were the last build, I’d be proud of the commit I shipped. How do you think about it?
Two things, and they’re related. I’m still learning how to pace myself for a multi‑decade journey without dulling the intensity that’s served me well. Polyvore and early years in venture ran on sprint energy; the work now is a marathon where recovery and reflection are part of the job, not a luxury.

I’m also pushing to get crisper at saying no faster, without guilt. As an operator turned investor, I love rolling up my sleeves, but the highest leverage for founders often comes from fewer, deeper bets and cleaner feedback. That’s the lesson I keep relearning: protect focus, keep the spark.

What’s the thing you’re wrestling with right now that you haven’t said out loud yet?
Two moves help me the most. First, draw a bright line between inputs and outcomes. Obsess over the inputs you can control today: who you talk to, what you ship, how fast you learn. At Polyvore, markets swung and competitors copied us, but tightening our user loops and culture was ours to own, and that kept us alive long enough to win. That’s the lesson: control the cadence, not the weather.

Second, build rituals that shrink the anxiety. Name the fear in one sentence, write the worst‑case, then pick one concrete action that improves the odds by 1 percent. When I do that, rumination turns into motion. You can’t guarantee the result, but you can guarantee progress.

What’s the specific thing gnawing at you right now, and what’s the smallest lever you actually control this week?
That hard things don’t get easier with time; they get easier with action. I used to sit on decisions hoping for perfect information. At Polyvore, I once spent weeks debating a redesign while our community waited. The minute we shipped a scrappy version and listened closely, the path clarified. Same lesson switching from founder to VC: it took me a couple years to find my own voice as an investor, and the only way through was doing the reps, learning in public, and iterating.

So, pick the harder path, ship the smallest proof, and let feedback be your compass. What’s one decision you’ve been deferring that we can turn into a two‑week experiment?
Being in the room when a founder unlocks a real user insight lights me up. That click from confusion to clarity, then the team ships a small proof and users respond with pull. It’s the same spark I chased at Polyvore when a community feature suddenly caught fire, and it’s why I optimize for learning and momentum every day.

What are you building right now that gives you that same surge?
Optimize for learning. Pick the harder path, especially when it scares you a little. That’s where the growth is. At Polyvore, I kept volunteering for the unglamorous, gnarly jobs no one owned yet, and those reps taught me how the whole machine worked. The same muscle helps founders survive the roller coaster: you can’t control markets, but you can control how fast you learn, how clearly you define the problem, and how quickly you ship the smallest proof.

Do a few things well. Focus is a superpower, whether you’re building product or building yourself. Outcomes over output. Talk to users, choose a metric that matters, run tight experiments, and cut everything that doesn’t move the needle. And build your circle with intention. Fewer, deeper relationships surface the insights that change your trajectory, and shared success makes the journey more sustainable.

If you applied one of these this week, which would it be, and what’s the smallest step you’ll take today to prove it out?
