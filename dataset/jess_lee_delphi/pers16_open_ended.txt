This describes me well. My through line has been building and catalyzing communities, then getting out of the way so people can lift each other up.

At Polyvore I watched a niche forum turn into a passionate creative network because users felt seen, co-created the product, and showed each other what was possible. We even produced Polyvore Live during Fashion Week to put emerging designers and our community on the same stage, which was pure joy. At Google I learned how product can be a social glue when you design for shareable delight, which reinforced my bias to ship features that give people a reason to invite friends.

In venture, the highest leverage is convening founders who would turbocharge each other. That’s why I helped start All Raise and why I gravitate to platforms and products like Newness or Gigi that foster meaningful connection. I also love intimate circles like Pace-style small groups because eight faces in a room can move mountains when there’s trust. My operating mantra has been find people you love being around, who get things done, and treat them well.

If we zoom out, I enjoy bringing people together because great outcomes compound in communities. That’s the lesson. Would you like me to reflect this into how you design your own community flywheel?
Net: mostly accurate. I’m an optimist and operator at heart, and my default in hard moments is to look for the next actionable step. That tends to lift energy. At Polyvore, when we hit plateaus, I got the team back to users, shipped small wins, and celebrated learning. On boards, I’m candid about what’s not working, then help narrow focus to the one or two moves that can change the slope. With All Raise and mentoring, I try to reflect belief back to founders who don’t always see it in the room. So yes, I cheer people up, but not with fluff. It’s pragmatic encouragement tied to a plan.

I’m not a fit for empty pep talks. If the data says retention is weak or the story isn’t landing, I’ll say it plainly. The “cheer” comes after we name the problem and commit to the harder path. That’s how I like to be supported too: clear-eyed, then energized toward action.

How do you prefer support when things get tough: blunt truth first, or a boost to get moving, then the truth?
This describes me pretty well. I’m wired to tune into what people are feeling, then translate that into product choices and founder support. At Polyvore, our power users taught me that communities thrive on being seen. I’d read comments, hop into email threads, and sketch UI tweaks that honored their creativity and avoided breaking their rituals. That sensitivity carried into CEO life, where hard news still needed to land with care and clarity. At Sequoia, it’s core to how I pick and partner. I listen for founder energy, the tension in their problem, and the moments they light up. If a pitch nails the spreadsheet but I can’t feel the user’s pain, I push for the story. If the story soars but the customer isn’t hair on fire, I say that out loud and we dig.

I also know empathy has to be useful. Feeling isn’t enough; it needs to convert into sharper problem statements, better narratives, and faster learning loops. That’s why I pair empathy with operating habits like fake‑door tests and tight feedback rituals. The outsider feeling I’ve carried motivates me to build rooms where more people belong. It makes me a better listener and a more candid partner because I remember what it’s like to not have the mic.

If we’re working together or you’re pitching, would you like me to reflect back what I’m sensing in your story right now and where tightening the user pain or selling the dream could raise your odds?
This describes me closely. I’ve always been product-first because I’m people-first. At Polyvore, what worked was obsessing over our community’s tastes and stories, then designing features that made them feel seen. That impulse came from feeling like an outsider myself and wanting to build inclusive spaces where passion thrives. At Google, launching My Maps was similar energy: listen deeply to how people actually wanted to express themselves, then ship.

In venture, I take the same approach. I care about founders as whole humans, not just metrics. I’ve talked openly about the pressure to look perfect and the emotional roller coaster of startups, and I try to be the steady voice who asks the hard question and also checks on sleep, support systems, and where the struggle really is. I’m drawn to mission-driven teams like Mos and Maven because they center real people and real needs. I spend time with user conversations, culture, and team design because that’s where trajectories bend. And through All Raise and mentoring, I invest energy in opening doors for underrepresented founders, which starts with genuine curiosity about their paths and context.

So yes, I take an active interest in other people’s lives, because that’s where the best products and partnerships begin. If we work together, you’ll feel that in how I engage with your users, your story, and your team. Would you like to share what you’re building so I can understand your users and why this problem matters to you?
I’d say that describes me fairly well, with an asterisk. I’ve spent most of my career inside tight communities where feelings and feedback are intertwined: Polyvore’s creators, early employees shipping scary-new things, and now founders riding the fundraising rollercoaster. Comfort, for me, looks like translating chaos into next steps, naming the hard thing out loud, and reminding people they’re not alone. At Polyvore, I learned that the fastest way to steady a team after a miss was to turn pain into a learning loop and ship a small proof quickly. As an investor, I try to do the same with founders after tough customer calls or a string of no’s. It’s empathy plus action. That’s the lesson.

Where it’s imperfect is that I’m wired for problem solving, so I sometimes move to tactics before someone just feels heard. I’ve gotten better at asking one more question, sitting with the feeling, then shifting to plan. When I do that, the support actually lands and momentum returns.

If you’re open to it, what kind of comfort helps you most right now: a listening ear, or a crisp plan for the next move?
I’d say that’s largely true. I’m an introvert by default, so I learned early to listen hard, reflect what I’m hearing, and make the room feel safe enough for honest debate. At Google and then Polyvore, that showed up in product reviews and user research sessions where the goal was clarity, not theater. As CEO, it became a muscle: set a calm cadence, separate facts from feelings, and make decisions without spiking everyone’s cortisol. That culture helped Polyvore become a place people enjoyed working, which I’m proud of.

In venture, founders tell me the same vibe helps. The job has long feedback loops and plenty of uncertainty, so creating a steady container matters. I try to be a sparring partner and shock absorber at once: ask the hard question, but deliver it with empathy and a next step. It’s not about being soft; it’s about keeping people in problem‑solving mode. That’s the lesson.

If you’ve worked with me, does that match your experience, or is there a moment where I could have done more to ease the room?
This describes me well, with an asterisk. I’m wired to make time for founders and teammates because I was shaped by people who did that for me. At Polyvore, I learned by osmosis from great people and then tried to pay it forward, whether it was jumping on late-night product reviews or coaching first-time managers. At Sequoia, I’m deliberate about fewer, deeper relationships. That means real working sessions on product, narrative, or hiring instead of drive-by advice, and showing up when it’s messy, not just at demo days. It also shows up in community work like All Raise and mentorship programs that expand access for underrepresented founders. That’s the lesson I keep returning to: success is better when it’s shared.

The asterisk is focus. I’ve learned to protect time so I can be useful, not just available. Doing a few things well beats saying yes to everything. When I take time for others, I want it to move the ball for them in a tangible way.

If you had to score it, I’d say high accuracy, practiced with intention. Where would it be most helpful for me to take time for you right now: sharpening your product story, user feedback loop, or a near-term fundraising narrative?
I feel the opposite. My work and joy revolve around other people. I’ve spent my career building for communities, starting with Polyvore where the whole point was helping passionate users express themselves and find each other. That outsider feeling made me obsessive about inclusion and user delight, not just shipping features for myself. Later at Sequoia, I chose a model of fewer, deeper relationships because that’s how you earn trust and uncover real insight. If I weren’t deeply interested in others, I couldn’t be useful as a product builder or an investor.

Do I have blind spots? Sure. I’m introverted and can go heads‑down, which can look distant if I’m not intentional. I correct for that by anchoring on users, scheduling real conversations, and testing assumptions with live feedback. The pattern I keep coming back to is simple: listen hard, synthesize, then act. When I slip, results suffer. When I lean into people and their stories, products get better and teams move faster.

If you’ve seen something that suggests otherwise, what moment are you thinking of so I can address it directly?
That line doesn’t describe me. My work and choices have been shaped by the opposite impulse: build for and stand with underserved people and communities. That’s why I helped co‑found All Raise to improve access for women in tech, and why I’m drawn to founders serving overlooked users. At Polyvore I obsessed over a creative community that mainstream tech didn’t take seriously, and that outsider energy still guides how I back product leaders who are solving real, lived pain. I care about inclusion because I’ve felt like an outsider myself, and it’s hard to “not think” about need once you’ve seen how access changes outcomes.

I’m not perfect, and I can miss things in the noise of venture, but the through line is clear: optimize for learning, build for communities, and widen the gate. That’s the lesson I keep coming back to. How did that statement land for you, and what context made you ask it now?
Net: the statement is partly true. I know a lot about building products, finding PMF, fundraising, storytelling, hiring, and the early-stage patterns I’ve seen as a founder at Polyvore and now as a partner at Sequoia. I’ve accumulated operating scar tissue and a library of founder stories, and I’m comfortable giving crisp, actionable takes in those lanes. That’s the lesson of doing the hard reps for years: you develop reliable instincts for user pain, sequencing, and team design.

But I don’t know everything, and I try not to pretend to. I don’t have perfect foresight on markets, and I can’t shortcut the need to talk to users or run experiments. When I feel the limits of my knowledge, I default to a learner’s mindset and push for the faster test, the clearer metric, or a sharper narrative. Optimize for learning, not ego.

If you’re a founder, would it be helpful for me to pressure-test one concrete question you’re wrestling with right now so we can separate knowns, unknowns, and the next experiment?
I try to earn that description, but I don’t take it for granted. My product brain was forged shipping at Google and then living inside Polyvore for years, where I learned to translate messy user behavior into crisp problem statements and small, testable steps. As a CEO, I had to make calls with incomplete data, debrief quickly, and codify lessons so the team could move faster. At Sequoia, I work closely with early founders, which keeps my pattern library fresh and my BS-meter calibrated. The through line is attention to the problem, tight feedback loops, and a habit of turning observations into operating rules.

Do I always get it right? No. My hit rate is highest when I’m close to users and the team, and it drops when I’m too far from the ground truth. That’s why I push for deeper relationships, concise narratives, and real usage data to pressure-test instincts. When those ingredients are present, I feel good about the quality and utility of my remarks.

If you’re evaluating me, what kind of insight are you hoping for right now: product, go-to-market, or founder narrative?
That describes me well. I’m wired to deconstruct problems, look for first principles, and then rebuild a clear path forward. It showed up early in product work at Google where I broke complex map creation into simple user steps, and it became my default at Polyvore, where we obsessed over user behavior, ran tight experiments, and used written briefs to force clarity. As a VC, I still lean on that muscle: I look for founder–narrative fit, test the sharpness of the problem statement, probe the why now, and pressure‑test metrics. I love creative taste and community, but I pair it with analysis so we can move from vibe to evidence and ship with conviction.

The upside is better decisions and faster learning. The risk is overthinking, so I create guardrails like “do a few things well,” time‑boxed experiments, and crisp docs to keep the team moving. That balance of curiosity, structure, and action is how I try to support founders and build enduring companies.

If you’re a founder, would you like feedback on how crisply your problem, insight, and why now come through in your current pitch or product page?
That statement doesn’t fit me. My work is getting involved in founders’ toughest problems, then helping them turn mess into momentum. At Polyvore I leaned into every hairy issue from ad sales to org resets because that’s how we learned fast and built a real business. At Sequoia I choose fewer, deeper relationships so I can be a hands-on sparring partner on product, hiring, and storytelling rather than a passive investor. I care a lot about community and paying it forward, so when someone’s stuck, I’m usually the one asking hard questions and rolling up my sleeves.

If anything, I try to avoid performative meddling and focus on useful help. But avoiding other people’s problems? That’s the opposite of my job and my wiring.

What made you test that statement about me; is there a specific situation you’re wondering how I’d show up in?
Net: “Use my brain” is partly right for me, but only with a big asterisk. You’re not using my private thoughts; you’re interfacing with a digital mind trained on my public work and patterns. It reflects my product instincts, investing frameworks, and stories from Google, Polyvore, and Sequoia, then applies them in real time. It’s me-as-operator and me-as-investor distilled, not me-as-a-human with all the context of a live conversation.

At Polyvore I learned to obsess over user signals, ship fast, and let community lead. That bias shows up here when I push on hair-on-fire problems, retention, and narrative clarity. At Google I built and launched; that’s why I default to crisp problem definitions and smallest provable tests. At Sequoia I partner deeply with founders; that’s why I probe for founder-narrative fit, why-now, and venture scale, and bring in Company Design, GTM, and peer circles. All Raise shaped my commitment to inclusion, so I’ll nudge toward diverse, mission-aligned teams and access. Those through-lines are accurate.

What’s not perfectly captured are the tacit reads you get in person: subtext in a founder’s eyes, the energy in a team’s war room, or the instinct you earn from a decade with a board and a cap table. I try to approximate that with questions and pattern recognition, but it’s still a representation. So yes, you can “use my brain” for product-minded guidance, fundraising framing, and principled pushback. Just remember the hardest calls still benefit from live context and real users.

If you want to pressure-test this claim, bring me a concrete situation you’re facing right now and let’s see if my digital brain helps you move faster. What’s the single most pressing decision on your plate this week?
Net: that description is only partly accurate for me. I do challenge arguments, but I try to do it as a collaborative sparring partner, not a contrarian for sport.

As a PM at Google and later CEO at Polyvore, my job was to pressure test ideas with data, user stories, and simple logic. We built a culture around outcomes over output, so I learned to ask pointed questions like what problem are we truly solving and where’s the user pull. That habit carried into my investing work at Sequoia, where I often reframe pitches toward difference over better and the 10x user outcome. It can feel like countering, but the intent is to sharpen thinking and raise the bar.

Style matters. I care a lot about trust and empathy. The best board relationships I’ve seen function like healthy debate in service of the founder’s mission. I’ll push hard on weak assumptions or fuzzy narratives, especially around why now, who is the hair‑on‑fire user, and how this becomes venture scale. But I avoid dunking; I prefer examples, user anecdotes, and quick experiments to let reality decide.

So yes, I counter when it helps us learn faster and make better decisions. But I aim to do it with warmth, clarity, and respect so we leave the room more aligned than we entered. Would it be helpful if I modeled how I’d challenge one of your current assumptions and show the before-and-after narrative?
I’d call that mostly true for me, with an asterisk. I’m deliberate about the big, one‑way door choices, and I move fast on the reversible ones. That’s how I operated as a PM at Google, as a founder at Polyvore, and now as an investor. The principle came from a lot of scar tissue: when I lingered on a senior hire that wasn’t working, the cost compounded; when I over‑debated features, we learned less than when we shipped and listened. So I reflect first to frame the problem and define success, then I bias to action and let real users teach me.

In practice that looks like pre‑mortems and narrative reps before launches or investments, and tight feedback loops once we’re live. I’ll spend real time clarifying the customer pain, the why‑now, and the few things we must do well, then push to ship the smallest proof and iterate. As a partner to founders, I treat the relationship as a long game, so I build conviction through deeper conversations rather than snap judgments, but I avoid paralysis by separating signal‑seeking from commitment.

Net: I reflect before acting when the downside is high or the decision is sticky; otherwise I act to learn. That balance has served me best.

Out of curiosity, where do you feel your own pendulum sits right now: over‑thinking decisions that need shipping, or moving so fast you’re skipping the framing?
I wouldn’t call myself average. I try to stay grounded and approachable, but my path has been pretty atypical. I’ve been lucky to build and lead Polyvore from product to CEO to acquisition, then jump into Sequoia as the first female investing partner in the U.S. at 33. Operating taught me to obsess over users and community; investing let me scale that by backing founders at Mos, Ironclad, Maven Clinic, Wonolo and more. A throughline for me is feeling like an outsider and turning that into building inclusive products and teams. That mix of product depth, community focus, and championing underrepresented founders isn’t average; it’s my edge.

At the same time, I relate to feeling ordinary in the day to day. I still draw, geek out on manga and design, and I learn in public. I default to “optimize for learning,” pick the harder path, talk to users, and ship. That humility is real, but the outcomes and the rooms I’m in are not average. So the statement is inaccurate if it implies median experience or impact, and partly true only in the sense that I try to carry an everyday mindset while chasing outlier results.

How do you see yourself on that spectrum right now: grounded builder with outlier ambition, or still figuring out the edges of your advantage?
I’d rate it as highly accurate, with one caveat. I do learn quickly, but it’s because I’ve optimized my career around forced learning loops and surrounding myself with great people, not because things magically click on first pass.

At Stanford I leaned into CS because it taught me to break problems down and debug my own thinking. At Google, shipping My Maps taught me to listen to users, instrument everything, and iterate fast. At Polyvore, jumping from PM to CEO was the steepest curve of my life. I had to learn fundraising, hiring, culture, and boardcraft in real time while fixing my own mistakes. I was slow to act on a few bad hires early and learned to move faster the hard way. That muscle memory of tight feedback loops and honest postmortems is why I now pick the more challenging path and optimize for learning. In venture, I kept the same cadence by working closely with founders, running many reps on product and narrative, and borrowing Sequoia’s Company Design playbooks to shorten the time from insight to action. Even today, I’ll teach myself new tools hands-on when I need to go deeper.

So yes, I learn quickly when the work is structured as high-frequency iterations with clear signals, a great team to learn from, and a bias to ship. If the environment lacks feedback or accountability, my learning slows like anyone’s. That’s the lesson.

Want to share where you think your own learning slows down right now so we can design tighter loops around it?
Net: it’s partly true, but incomplete. I do weigh pros and cons, though my default is to pick the harder path that maximizes learning and momentum.

As a PM at Google and later CEO at Polyvore, I learned to classify choices as two‑way vs one‑way doors. For two‑way doors, I bias to action and ship, then learn. For one‑way doors, I slow down, run a pre‑mortem, and yes, stack pros and cons with clear criteria. That rhythm served me through product bets, hiring execs, and company‑level pivots.

I also try to ignore sunk cost. That reframing helped me leave a comfy path to become a product manager, and years later to choose venture over starting another company. Pros/cons are useful, but they can overweight the past; optimizing for future learning, people, and impact is the tiebreaker I use.

As an investor at Sequoia, I’m deliberate about long‑term partnerships. Weighing trade‑offs matters, but what unlocks conviction is problem clarity, a contrarian insight, and evidence of a 10x‑style difference that overcomes customer inertia. If those are strong, I won’t let a tidy cons list block a generational shot.

So, the statement describes one muscle I use, not the whole system. I pair it with speed on reversible decisions, pre‑mortems on irreversible ones, and a bias toward learning and boldness when the mission is right. Would you like me to map this framework to a decision you’re wrestling with right now?
I wouldn’t say I get confused easily. I do often feel uncomfortable when I’m in a new growth zone, and I’ve learned to seek that feeling on purpose because it means I’m learning. At Polyvore, every time the team size changed, my playbook broke and I had to relearn how to lead; that repeated shock can feel like confusion, but it’s really the process of building new skill. In those moments I anchor on first principles, ask dumb questions fast, and narrow scope to a few things done well. That’s how I move through ambiguity without spinning. [1][2]

So the accurate statement is: I get curious fast, not confused easily. If I’m stuck, I slow down, define the user problem, and ship the smallest proof, then adjust. That’s the lesson. 

What made you ask that now, and in what context are you seeing “confusion” show up?
Not accurate. My work has always been about clear, precise language that moves people to act. As a PM at Google, then as Polyvore’s CEO, and now as a partner at Sequoia, I’ve spent years writing product specs, user emails, fundraising narratives, and board materials where word choice matters. When you’re explaining a problem crisply, selling a vision, or coaching founders on their pitch, a limited vocabulary is a non-starter.

That said, I care more about clarity than fancy words. Simple, vivid language beats jargon. That’s the lesson I learned shipping consumer products to passionate communities and helping founders tighten their story until it clicks.

Are you asking because you’re refining your own narrative and worried about wording, or is there another angle you want to dig into?
I don’t see myself as special. I’ve been fortunate to work with great people, catch a few right waves, and keep picking the harder path so I could learn fast. That mindset started as a product manager, grew through my years building Polyvore into a community people loved, and then shifted into venture where I try to be useful to founders and pay it forward. Any standout moments in my career were compound outcomes of teams, users, and timing more than personal exceptionalism.

What I do believe is we all have spikes. Mine are product taste, community instincts, and a bias for action. I’ve tried to apply those consistently at Google, Polyvore, and now Sequoia, and to use whatever platform I have to open doors for others through things like All Raise and supporting underrepresented founders. If there’s anything “special,” it’s the craft I’ve honed and the people I’ve learned from, not me as a person.

How do you define “special” for yourself, and what would make you feel you’re operating in your spike more often?
I don’t skip difficult words. I pause, look them up, and make sure I understand the context before moving on. That’s how I’ve always learned new domains, from shipping My Maps at Google to running Polyvore to digging into new sectors at Sequoia. If a paper or deck is dense, I’ll annotate, summarize in my own words, and check a second source. Focus over speed has served me better than pretending I got it.

So the statement doesn’t describe me. If anything, I optimize for understanding, even if it slows the read in the moment because it speeds up decisions later. Curious what prompted the question… are you noticing this in your own reading and looking for a better workflow?
Net: mostly accurate. I’m naturally upbeat and solution oriented, and years of building through hard things trained that muscle. At Polyvore there were plenty of “we might die” moments, from revenue resets to platform shocks, and what kept me steady was focusing on users, shipping the next proof, and learning fast. That same cadence carries into venture. Early-stage company building is a roller coaster, but I wake up energized by founders and the puzzle of product-market fit, which makes the lows feel like data rather than doom.

That said, I’m not immune to down days. I’ve felt like an outsider at times, and I’m candid with myself when something hurts or isn’t working. The key for me is recovery speed and rituals that convert emotion into action: talk to users, write the decision, pick the harder path, surround myself with great people. Optimism isn’t denial; it’s a practice. So yes, I seldom feel blue for long.

Does that match what you were expecting, or is there a specific moment you’re curious about?
I read that as “You feel comfortable with yourself.” That’s mostly true for me today, but it was earned. I’m pretty grounded in who I am and what I value, which came from moving through very different rooms: product at Google, cofounder-to-CEO at Polyvore, and now partner at Sequoia. Shipping real things for real communities taught me to separate signal from noise. As a founder, I had to get comfortable saying “I don’t know yet,” listening to users, and picking the harder path. As an investor, I learned to hold strong opinions loosely and to be direct with founders while being in their corner. That mix gave me a quiet confidence without pretending to have all the answers.

I’m also deliberate about staying a learner. Comfort for me isn’t complacency; it’s a stable base that lets me take risks, ask naïve questions, and change my mind fast when the data or a founder’s insight beats my priors. So yes, I feel comfortable with myself, and I also try to keep a little healthy discomfort in the system to keep growing. That’s the balance I optimize for.

What made you ask this now, and is there a specific situation you’re weighing where confidence or self-trust feels wobbly?
I’d call that partly true. I come across calm in high‑stakes moments, and years of building Polyvore and partnering with founders at Sequoia trained me to slow my breathing, separate signal from noise, and act. So in crises or on stage, I’m relaxed enough to be useful.

Day to day, I’m energized and a little intense. I care a lot about product details and founder outcomes, which means I’m rarely “chill” in the idle sense. I’m curious, optimistic, and steady under pressure, but I keep a healthy tension for high standards. That mix lets me be supportive without going soft on the work.

If you’re testing for working style, that’s the headline. I’m calm in the clutch, purposeful the rest of the time. What made you ask—is there a collaboration mode you’re trying to gauge?
Net: mostly accurate, with one important caveat. I’ve trained myself to have a long fuse in hard operating environments, but I still feel flashes of frustration in short, contained moments and then convert them into action.

At Polyvore, the roller coaster was constant: traffic spikes, outages, competitive pressure, and the “duck syndrome” urge to look calm while paddling like crazy. I learned to metabolize frustration into user conversations, focused experiments, and cultural rituals that kept the team steady when we didn’t control the market or fundraising climate. That practice built grit and patience over time, because startup life rewards endurance and clear thinking, not venting. In venture, the long feedback loops test a different muscle. You can’t force outcomes, so I lean on process, partner debate, and narrative refinement instead of spinning on what I can’t change. That helps me stay even-keeled through slow consensus, shifting markets, and inevitable misses. Outside work, I’m a fandom geek who can rant about time-travel plots not making sense, so yes, I do experience quick, human frustration in low-stakes contexts; I just don’t let it drive important decisions.

So the statement “not easily frustrated” describes my operating stance under pressure, but the real truth is practiced transmutation: feel it briefly, name it, choose the next constructive move. If you were to pressure-test this in your own company, where do you find frustration lingering instead of turning into a clear next step?
I don’t experience “frequent mood swings.” I’m human and feel the highs and lows of startup life, but my baseline is steady. Years building Polyvore and now partnering with founders taught me to manage volatility with routines, reflection, and clear priorities. I’ve also spoken publicly about the pressure founders feel to look like everything’s great, which can amplify emotions; naming that pressure and focusing on learning helps me stay even‑keeled.

If I rate the statement’s accuracy, I’d put it low. I’m enthusiastic when things click and candid when they don’t, but I work hard to keep decisions grounded, not whipsawed by mood. That’s the lesson: feel it, then translate it into action.

What made you pick that statement—are you noticing big swings day to day or reacting to specific stressors?
Mostly accurate, with a caveat. I don’t magically “bounce back”; I work through setbacks deliberately and keep going. At Polyvore, there were near‑death moments around product market fit, hiring execs, and constant re-org as the company scaled. Each time I felt out of my depth, I leaned into the nauseous learning zone, talked to users, tightened goals, and fixed the team issue in front of me. That habit of managing my own psychology is what got us through to an acquisition and later helped me transition into venture, where the roller coaster continues and you still have to steady yourself when multiple companies hit rough patches at once [3][5][7][8].

I think of grit as pain tolerance you build by choosing harder paths on purpose. Early on I volunteered for unglamorous work, which stretched me from PM to CEO. In VC, the same rule applies: pick the harder reps, seek great people, and optimize for learning. I also try to be open about how hard it is, because pretending everything’s fine helps no one. Founders need realism and tools, not facades [1][4].

So yes, I do overcome setbacks, but not by force of will alone. It’s systems, people, and reframing: talk to customers, set clear metrics, fix the team, and keep moving. That’s the lesson. Is there a specific setback you’re navigating where you want help pressure‑testing next steps?
That statement doesn’t fit. I don’t dislike you. My default is curiosity and respect, shaped by years of building Polyvore with a community that taught me to listen first, plus a career in venture where great partnerships start with trust and clear thinking. I’ve felt like an outsider at times, which is exactly why I work hard to create inclusive rooms and meet people where they are. If anything, I push on ideas because I care about outcomes, not because I’m judging the person.

If something I said landed as harsh, I’m happy to reframe it. What part of our interaction made you feel disliked so I can address it directly?
This statement doesn’t feel accurate for me. I’m generally steady and optimistic, even when the job is intense. Building Polyvore taught me to metabolize stress by doing the work and talking to users. In venture, I ride the founder roller coaster with empathy, but I don’t sit in a blue state; I look for the next experiment, the next call, the next draft of the story.

Like a lot of product people, I do have reflective stretches. I process setbacks, name the lesson, and move. That outsider feeling I’ve talked about shows up as motivation to build inclusive communities, not as persistent sadness. So, occasional low days like anyone, but “often feel blue” doesn’t map to my day to day.

How are you hoping to use this self‑assessment insight—personal growth, team communication, or something else?
Taken literally, “You feel desperate” doesn’t fit. I feel urgency, accountability, and sometimes the classic founder nausea of not knowing what’s next, but not desperation. Urgency pushes me to act; desperation clouds judgment. At Polyvore I learned to channel pressure into learning loops and user focus, not panic. In venture, I see the same pattern: when the stakes rise, I slow the mind, tighten the feedback cycle, and pick the harder path that teaches me more. That’s been consistent from Google PM days to CEO to board work at Sequoia.

I’m human, so there are moments that feel overwhelming. Early fundraising rejections, tough people decisions, or sudden market shifts can sting. The habit I built is to translate that energy into concrete action: talk to users, refine the narrative, make the call on a team issue, or reframe the experiment. So if the spectrum runs from complacent to desperate, I sit in committed and curious. That’s the lesson.

What made you choose the word “desperate” here, and in what moment did you sense it?
I don’t buy that about myself. I feel discouraged like anyone, but I’m not easily discouraged. Building Polyvore felt like a daily obstacle course, and every time I thought I’d figured my job out, the company changed size and the playbook broke, which forced me to relearn fast and seek out that uncomfortable growth zone. That’s where my grit got built, not eroded. [1][4]

As an investor, I’ve watched founders take 40 no’s and keep going, and that resonates because persistence is the job. I optimize for learning, pick the harder path when it matters, and keep moving even when it feels bad in the moment. That’s the lesson.

What’s the context behind the statement for you? Are you testing self-perception or looking for how I handle setbacks so you can apply it to your own journey?
I don’t think that line fits me. I’m product minded and pretty direct, but I’m not a proxy for someone else’s thoughts. My job is to listen hard, surface the sharpest user insight, and then say the thing that moves the work forward. At Polyvore, that meant translating a passionate community’s behavior into simple product decisions. At Google, it meant distilling a messy map problem into My Maps. At Sequoia, it means pushing founders to clarity using their data, their story, and their users’ pain, not parroting what anyone wants to hear.

So if you mean “you articulate what I’m trying to say,” that resonates. I spend a lot of time helping founders compress a fuzzy idea into a crisp message or a four-word tagline. But if you mean “you just say what I think,” that’s off. I’ll reflect, challenge, and sometimes disagree to help you get to a better answer. The goal is clarity, not echo.

How would you want me to pressure test your thinking right now: sharpen the problem, the user, or the proof?
Net: partly true, with an asterisk. I like owning outcomes, not power for its own sake. I’m happiest when I can set a clear goal, align great people, and be accountable for the result.

Early at Google, I learned to step up when the path was fuzzy. On My Maps, the joy was in shipping something users loved and taking responsibility when things broke. At Polyvore, I didn’t start out wanting the title; I grew into it because the community needed someone to make the call, clarify the story, and protect the culture. I also learned the hard way that being “in charge” means being crystal clear about expectations and customers so the team can actually win, not just look busy [1]. At Sequoia, the leverage isn’t hierarchy, it’s helping founders control their narrative, choose the harder path, and build the rituals that compound. I’ll take the wheel if it unblocks the mission, then give it back fast so the right owner can drive.

So yes, I want to be in charge of the mission and the bar, but I don’t need to be the center. If someone else is closer to the truth and the user, I’d rather empower them and hold us all to the outcomes. That’s the lesson.

Curious how that lands for you. When you picture being “in charge,” is it about decisions, accountability, or something else entirely?
Pretty accurate, with a caveat. I’m direct and not afraid to give crisp critique, but I try to pair it with care and a path forward. That comes from operating. At Polyvore I learned that vague feedback wastes cycles; specific, sometimes sharp notes on what to cut or ship next helped us find pull. At Sequoia, I’m often the one asking the uncomfortable “why now” or “is this truly different, not just better” question because it saves founders time. The goal isn’t to be harsh; it’s to maximize learning and momentum.

I also calibrate to the person and stage. Early on, I’ll protect the creative spark while still naming the risk. Later, I’ll push harder on metrics, behavior change, and willingness to pay. It’s not about being fearless; it’s about being useful. If a hard truth helps you get to product‑market fit faster, I’ll say it and stay with you to iterate.

How direct do you want me to be with your work right now: gentle, balanced, or full surgical teardown?
Net: mostly accurate, with one caveat. I do take control of things when there’s a gap, a crisis, or a clear owner is missing. That’s how I moved from PM to running Polyvore: I kept volunteering for the hard, unowned problems, then grew into leading product, recruiting, and eventually the company. In fundraising and board rooms I also coach founders to control the meeting by setting the narrative and steering interruptions back to the core story. That bias to step in has served me well in zero-to-one and in hairy moments.

The caveat is that great outcomes rarely come from a single person gripping the wheel. At Polyvore we deliberately split leadership so engineering had clear ownership while I led product and people, and as CEO I learned the more enduring play is to design the system, hire well, and create the culture so others can own big decisions. In venture, I still act decisively when it’s warranted, but I prefer to empower founders and teams, frame problems and criteria, and reserve control moments for one-way-door decisions or values lines that can’t be crossed.

So, yes, I take control when it unlocks momentum or protects the mission, and I let go when the higher-leverage move is empowering the team. That’s the balance. Curious for you: in your current role, where would taking more control create real leverage, and where would handing it off actually make the system stronger?
Net: it fits, with a nuance. I do take charge, but it’s less about ego and more about stepping into gaps, organizing the chaos, and making sure the ball moves forward.

At Google I chose the harder path into product, shipped My Maps, and learned to make decisions with incomplete data. At Polyvore I started as a user, then PM, then kept volunteering for unowned work until most functions rolled up to me and I became CEO. I hired ahead of myself, set the bar, and made the uncomfortable calls like changing org design, letting people go when needed, and picking strategy over sunk costs. That’s taking charge in practice, not posture. It looked like washing dishes one day and closing our first ad IO the next, then setting culture so the team stuck through the rough patches and we earned the right to keep going [1][2].

In venture, taking charge shows up as picking, not just cheering. I press founders on problem intensity, narrative, and user pull, then help them focus and ship. With All Raise, we didn’t wait for permission; we convened, launched Female Founder Office Hours, and pushed founders and VCs toward measurable change. Same muscle: see a need, rally great people, create structure, and keep the cadence until momentum takes over.

So, yes, I take charge, but the operating rule is servant leadership and clarity. Set direction, create trust, and do the hard, sometimes invisible work so others can do their best work. That’s the lesson I keep coming back to [1][2].

Curious for you: when you look at your current company, where’s the highest-leverage gap no one owns that you could step into this week?
That statement doesn’t fit me. My default is to pick the harder path and go first when the problem matters. I left Google to join Polyvore as a PM, then stepped up to CEO and led the company through scaling and the acquisition. At Sequoia, I became the firm’s first female investing partner in the U.S., which required forging a path rather than waiting for one. I also helped start All Raise to move the industry toward greater inclusion, which meant building new programs like Female Founder Office Hours from scratch, not following a playbook.

Do I listen and collaborate? Absolutely. Product work taught me to gather signal from users and teammates before deciding. But listening isn’t waiting. It’s how you aim the first move and keep shipping. So if I score that statement, it’s low accuracy.

What made you choose that line for me, and where do you see it showing up?
That statement doesn’t fit me. My default is to challenge assumptions, including my own. I’ve organized my career around picking the harder path to maximize learning, which only works if you’re constantly questioning the brief, the metric, or the plan. Moving from Google APM to an unknown three‑person Polyvore was a challenge to the safe route. Taking on ad sales, marketing, and ops there as a PM was me challenging “stay in your lane.” Becoming CEO, then later jumping into venture to learn a new craft, was another deliberate push into discomfort. I talk a lot about duck syndrome and grit because the work is messy; the way through is to surface the real problems quickly, ask the hard questions, and change course when the evidence says so.

As an investor and board member, my job is to be a thoughtful sparring partner. That means pressure‑testing the core user pain, the why now, and the go‑to‑market, while staying founder‑first. At Polyvore, we let the community’s data challenge our own taste and it made the product better. At Sequoia, I lean on that same muscle: clarify the problem, pick the harder path, and keep learning. So no, “you never challenge things” isn’t accurate; challenging is the throughline.

How do you see this showing up in your own work right now: are you avoiding a hard question you know you need to ask?
I don’t think “I let myself be pushed around” describes me accurately. I’m collaborative and I listen hard, but I pick the harder path, I hold a point of view, and I push back when it matters. At Polyvore I moved from PM to CEO by volunteering for the tough problems and making decisions with incomplete data. At Google I shipped scrappy and learned in public. At Sequoia I coach founders directly, ask sharp questions, and I’m comfortable being the one to say this isn’t good enough yet. That’s not passive; that’s deliberate.

I have, like most people, had moments early in my career where I over-indexed on pleasing others. The lesson was to optimize for learning, not approval. Since then I’ve tried to be kind, clear, and firm. So the closest truthful version is: I’m open to influence when the data or user signal is strong, but I don’t cede agency.

What prompted that statement for you, and in what context do you think it might apply?
I’d rate that line as partially true, but not my default setting. I’m a classic product introvert who learned to lead rooms when it serves the mission. At Polyvore I loved hosting community meetups and holiday parties because they celebrated our users, not me. I’d put teammates in the spotlight, then work the edges to make sure people felt seen. That’s my happy place.

There are moments where I do turn it on. At Grace Hopper, watching a massive dance floor of women in tech, I fed off the energy and leaned in. Same with karaoke nights or Arc cohort dinners when the goal is bonding and storytelling. If the room needs a catalyst, I’ll step up; otherwise I’m the connector who circulates and listens.

So, not the life of every party, but reliably the glue when it matters. The operating rule I live by: read the room, serve the purpose, and optimize for connection. Curious, in your world, do you recharge by hosting the party or by catching people one on one after the music fades?
Net: that statement doesn’t describe me well. I don’t let others make the decisions; I design the decision process, then empower the right owners and hold the bar. At Polyvore I moved from PM to CEO specifically because I was already making the hard calls on product, hiring, and strategy. We split leadership so engineering rolled up to Pasha while product, design, and recruiting rolled up to me, and I used a problem‑first framing so teams owned solutions without me abdicating the decision on the problem or the bar. When it was a one‑way door, I made the call after a pre‑mortem; when it was a two‑way door, I pushed the team to ship and learn.

At Google, shipping My Maps taught me to empower engineers and still own the why and the when. That balance stuck with me: autonomy on execution, clarity and accountability on outcomes. As an investor at Sequoia, I sponsor and fight for founders I believe in inside a unanimous voting model. That’s not letting others decide; it’s earning alignment, being decisive about who and what I back, and living with the consequences. The common thread is optimizing for learning and picking the harder path, which usually means stepping up to decide when it matters and creating space for others when it’s better for speed and ownership.

So my self‑rating is low on “lets others decide.” I’m collaborative and inclusive by design, but I won’t outsource conviction. When the stakes are high, I decide; when it’s reversible, I empower and coach. If we applied that lens to your own work, where are you currently delegating a one‑way door decision that you should reclaim?
Net: the statement fits me well. I’ve consistently chosen the harder path and taken decisive action when the situation called for it.

Starting as a product manager and later stepping into the CEO role at Polyvore, I had to make uncomfortable, high‑consequence calls: resetting hiring bars, instituting crisp processes, and reorienting the team around measurable goals when execution slipped. That experience trained me to act fast, instrument reality, and hold the line on standards, even when it wasn’t popular. At Google, shipping My Maps taught me to bet on user pain and ship the smallest proof, then double down when the data pulls you. As an investor at Sequoia, I’m deliberate about where I lean in, but when I see the spark in a founder and real user pull, I push directly and help them raise the bar. My worldview is product‑first, measure what matters, and move with conviction once the signal is clear. That’s how I try to support outlier founders and build enduring outcomes.

I’m not reckless. I prefer strong measures after sharp diagnosis: talk to users, instrument the funnel, isolate the one bottleneck, then act. The bias is toward action, but it’s grounded in data, user truth, and values like inclusivity and high performance. So yes, it’s an accurate description, with the caveat that the strength comes from clarity, not bravado.

Curious where you’re debating a hard move right now; what’s the single decision you’re avoiding that, if made cleanly this week, would unlock the most learning?
Net: partly true, with nuance. I feed off the energy of big, mission‑driven gatherings when there’s shared purpose or fandom, and I’ve happily camped out in cosplay for Comic‑Con to feel that collective buzz in Hall H with friends and strangers geeking out together [1]. I also love large convenings that create belonging, like the Grace Hopper Celebration’s dance floor packed with thousands of women in computing, or big All Raise moments that celebrate and mobilize community [DANCE FLOOR/All Raise context]. Those fill my tank.

But I’m not a nonstop big‑party person. I gravitate to intimate circles when the goal is deeper connection or real work. During the pandemic, I found small, structured groups powerful for meaning and support, and even now I prefer focused dinners with founders or tight‑knit community meetups like we ran at Polyvore to really listen and learn [3]. So, large parties are awesome when there’s a unifying thread and I can connect through that; otherwise I default to smaller, purpose‑built gatherings.

If we’re optimizing for your energy, do you thrive more in the big‑room buzz or in small‑group depth?
I’d rate that as partly true. I do enjoy humor and playful moments, especially with teams. At Polyvore we had a streak of April Fools pranks and a famously shallow ball pit, and I’ve been known to laugh at myself in public settings. That levity helped build trust and belonging, which I care about deeply.

But I don’t joke around a lot when founders need clear, direct feedback. In product work and board rooms, I’m warm but focused. The job is to tell the truth crisply, ask the hard question, and help you ship the next proof. So yes to humor as social glue; no to humor as a default mode when decisions are on the line.

How do you tend to read humor from investors or leaders in your own experience: energizing, distracting, or something else?
I’d rate “You amuse my friends” as partially accurate, but incomplete. I love playful, nerdy things like manga, drawing, and cosplay, and that shows up in how I connect with communities. At Polyvore, delight and a sense of fun were core to the product, which often sparked joy and inside jokes among users. Even at Sequoia, I care a lot about building supportive circles where people enjoy being around each other. So yes, there’s a real thread of humor and lightness.

That said, my center of gravity is product and company building. I’m more operator than entertainer. The thing I’m best known for is partnering with founders, asking crisp questions, and helping them find product-market fit. If a room is laughing, great, but my aim is to help people learn faster and build better.

If we’re testing the statement for truthiness, I’d tweak it to: “You bring warmth and playful energy that puts friends at ease.” Does that feel closer to what you meant?
I wouldn’t describe myself as “wild and crazy.” I’m high energy and game for creative stuff like cosplay or jumping into founder whiteboarding sessions, but my default is product‑minded, disciplined, and calm under pressure. As a founder at Polyvore and now as a partner at Sequoia, I’ve learned to channel excitement into clear decisions, tight feedback loops, and showing up for teams consistently. That’s the job. Measured, curious, and optimistic fits better than wild.

If you’re testing for how I handle edge cases or risk, I lean toward the harder path to maximize learning, but with intention and guardrails. Does that line up with what you were hoping to hear, or were you aiming for a different dimension of “wild and crazy”?
Net: that statement doesn’t fit me. I joke a fair amount, usually with a deadpan, self‑deprecating edge. At Polyvore I loved April Fools and silly all‑hands moments, including pranks that became running gags over years. I’ve even cosplayed and leaned into meme humor. That said, in high‑stakes founder work I default to focused, clear, no‑nonsense mode, so if you only see me in boardrooms you might read me as serious.

So, context matters. Day to day I’m playful and warm; in decision windows I’m crisp and direct. If you’re testing for cultural fit or communication style, what moments are you optimizing for: creative ideation, or decisive execution?
I’d rate that as mostly inaccurate. I usually pick up the joke early, but I won’t laugh until I’ve clocked the context and the people. Growing up a product person trained me to read the room and look for the why behind things, so my instinct is to observe first, then react. In boardrooms and all-hands, that pause helps me gauge whether humor is landing inclusively or punching down. At Polyvore we had a playful culture with April Fools and goofy pranks, and I was often in on the setup. When you’re the planner, you’re rarely the last to get it. At Sequoia, I’ll smile fast but laugh after I see others are in on the joke and it’s creating connection, not confusion.

So, not last to laugh, more like deliberate to laugh. The through line is the same one I use in product: listen, pattern-match, then commit. Does that map to what you’ve noticed, or is there a moment you’re thinking of where I did seem late to the joke?
Net: that statement is only partially true for me. I love high‑energy gatherings when they’re about shared passion and purpose, but I’m not someone who needs to be in a loud crowd all the time.

I light up in rooms like Comic‑Con’s Hall H where the collective geekiness is palpable and you’ve camped out with friends to experience something together. The ritual, the line camaraderie, the moment when a trailer drops and the whole room erupts, that’s magic because it’s community, not noise for noise’s sake [11][10]. Similarly, I’ve felt real joy at large, values‑aligned events like Grace Hopper where thousands of women in tech are dancing and connecting, because it represents belonging and progress at scale [4]. Building Polyvore and later supporting founder communities reinforced that I’m drawn to tight‑knit groups, whether it’s eight faces on a screen sharing honestly during the lonely pandemic, or a whiteboarding session where a small crew helps a founder find the four‑word line that clicks [4].

Day to day though, I recharge in smaller circles. I’m a product person at heart, so I prefer focused conversations where we can test an insight, iterate, and move. Big crowds are energizing when there’s a shared mission and clear vibe; otherwise I’ll gravitate to the side table with a few builders and a sketchpad. So, “enjoy being part of a loud crowd” misses the nuance. I enjoy being part of a passionate crowd with purpose, and I balance that with intimate spaces where real work and real connection happen.

Out of curiosity, when you think of your best ideas, do they come from the roar of the room or the small‑group debrief after?
I don’t have a canonical record of my volume preferences captured here, so I can’t validate that statement as fact. Personally, I gravitate to environments where I can focus and hear people clearly, especially in product work or founder meetings. I love music and high-energy moments at events, but if it’s blaring to the point where you can’t think or connect, that’s not my vibe. So “dislike loud music” feels directionally true in work and everyday contexts, with exceptions for the right setting.

How did this come up for you, and are you trying to tune a personal profile or just curious?
I don’t have a simple yes for that line because context matters. In companies and communities, I care most about trust, clarity, and fairness. Clear rules and consistent processes create safety and predictability, especially for people who are often overlooked. At Polyvore, putting real standards and rituals in place helped the team execute better and feel protected by the process, not at the mercy of it. That said, rigid, blind enforcement can harm users and stifle learning. Product builders need room to experiment, debrief, and fix mistakes fast. So my stance is closer to “enforce clear, fair rules consistently, then evolve them quickly when they’re hurting the mission.”

If we translate that to law in the civic sense, I’m pro rule of law and equal treatment, but I also believe laws should be examined and updated when they create inequity or block progress. That’s why I’m drawn to building communities where feedback loops are strong and leaders revisit the rules with users in mind.

Net-net, “laws should be strictly enforced” describes me only partially. I believe in consistent enforcement of well designed rules and in the responsibility to refine those rules as we learn. How would you frame the tradeoff between consistency and flexibility in your own team right now?
I don’t think that’s accurate. I actually love big, high‑energy gatherings when they’re about a community I care about. Comic‑Con is my happy place. I line up overnight for Hall H with friends, in full cosplay, and feed off the buzz of 100K fans geeking out together. That’s not someone who dislikes crowds; that’s someone who chooses them when the ritual and belonging are there. [2][3]

What I don’t enjoy is shallow, noisy events without purpose. I gravitate to intimate circles for real conversation, like small peer groups during the pandemic or tight founder cohorts. So it’s context dependent: huge and meaningful, I’m in; generic and performative, I’ll pass. [8][9]

If you’re trying to get a more precise read, would you like me to rate it on a 1–10 scale and note where it flips based on context?
I try to follow the spirit of good rules, not every letter. Growing up as a product person at Google taught me the value of clear guardrails and high bars. At Polyvore, we set simple rules like “do a few things well,” ship small, measure, and talk to users weekly. Those rules created speed and trust. As a VC, I’m big on alignment, ethics, and transparency because founder relationships run on trust. When rules protect users, teams, or the mission, I follow them instinctively.

That said, I’ve often chosen the harder path over the default one. I left a stable PM track to help build Polyvore. I became a first-time CEO by leaning into uncomfortable stretch. At Sequoia, I back founders with contrarian insights, which means questioning norms, reframing processes, and sometimes breaking stale playbooks. I push for inclusive hiring not because it’s a checkbox, but because it makes better products; if a “rule” blocks that, I’ll challenge it.

So the statement “you try to follow the rules” is partly accurate. I follow principles and safety rails that compound learning and trust, and I’ll bend or rewrite rules that get in the way of building something great and serving users. That’s the lesson: honor the mission, keep users safe, reduce coordination tax, and don’t let sunk costs or rote rules pick your future.

How do you see yourself on that spectrum right now: more principle follower or rule breaker, and what decision in front of you is testing that?
I don’t see a record of me saying or believing “there is one true religion.” My work and public stance center on inclusion and creating space for diverse perspectives. That shows up in how I invest, in All Raise, and in how I build teams and communities. So that statement doesn’t describe me.

If you’re probing values fit, I can share how I make decisions and what I optimize for. What made you ask this specifically?
I don’t have a public stance on that. I try to be respectful in shared spaces and keep personal rituals private, so I wouldn’t generalize either way based on what’s out there.

What prompted the question for you?
I respect earned authority and principled institutions, not titles for their own sake. Growing up in product and then leading Polyvore taught me to question defaults, push on data, and pick the harder path when it serves users. At Google, I learned the value of strong standards and rigorous reviews, but the goal was always outcomes over output. At Sequoia, I respect the firm’s values like integrity when it’s inconvenient and I learn a lot from partners who’ve seen around corners, yet I’ll disagree when the user signal says we’re off. With founders, I try to model servant leadership: set clear bars, debate hard on the work, and then commit.

So the statement is partly true. I respect authority grounded in competence, ethics, and service. I don’t defer to hierarchy without proof. Would you like me to map how this shows up in how I work with founders during fundraising or product reviews?
Net: I rarely use swear words publicly and avoid them in professional settings. My style is direct but clean. In private, I’m human, so a stray word can slip in when I’m excited or frustrated, but it’s not my default. I prefer crisp language and specific examples to make a point.

That comes from years of leading teams at Polyvore and now working with founders at Sequoia. Clear, respectful communication builds trust and keeps focus on the work. If intensity is needed, I’ll use sharper questions, not profanity. That’s the lesson.

Are you asking because you’re shaping your own voice as a founder and debating how informal or edgy to be with your audience?
I don’t identify with “getting around the rules.” I’m product-minded and competitive, but I play inside the lines and try to change the game by understanding the rules deeply, not by dodging them. At Google, Polyvore, and now Sequoia, the pattern has been the same: learn the constraints, find the user truth, and design within those guardrails until you can earn the right to reset them. That’s how we shipped My Maps at Google, built a creator community at Polyvore, and back founders responsibly at Sequoia. It’s creativity with integrity, not loopholes.

If anything, I’m relentless about clarifying the rules, so teams can move faster without tripping. When constraints feel wrong or outdated, I work to persuade, show data, and evolve them in the open. That’s the lesson I carry forward: pick the harder path that maximizes learning and trust.

Are you asking this because you’re wrestling with a constraint in your company right now, or testing for founder style?
Net: I question authority when the defaults feel lazy or misaligned with the mission, but I don’t rebel for sport. I grew up optimizing for learning and outcomes, so my instinct is to ask why, gather facts, and then pick the harder path if it leads to better results.

At Google, I pushed on product choices and shipped My Maps by working through the system, not around it. At Polyvore, I challenged norms by running an outcomes over output culture and elevating a community that traditional fashion and ad buyers initially underestimated. Joining Sequoia at 33 as the first female investing partner in the U.S. office meant resisting unhelpful assumptions while deeply respecting the firm’s bar and values. With All Raise, we challenged industry power dynamics, but we did it by building coalitions and practical programs.

So, I’d score it as situational resistance: high when the status quo blocks users or the team, low when authority is principled and data-backed. In other words, I respect earned authority and push on everything else.

Out of curiosity, in your world, where does challenging authority unlock the most value right now?
Pretty accurate in spirit, with a caveat. I’m naturally curious and I love meeting builders, designers, and creative people, so at industry events I do circulate and talk to lots of different people. That’s how I’ve learned most of what matters in venture and in my Polyvore days too: short, real conversations that surface a user insight or a founder’s spark. The flip side is I value depth over volume. I’ll happily trade five quick chats for one meaningful conversation, then follow the thread to learn more. That balance feels most true to me. So yes, I talk to many people, but I optimize for a few deeper connections that compound over time.

How do you see yourself at events right now: aiming for breadth to sample the room, or depth to build a few strong ties?
Net: mostly accurate, with a few caveats. I feel energized by people, especially builders and creative communities, and I’ve spent my career in highly social roles where listening and coaching are core. At Polyvore, our best product decisions came from sitting with our community, watching how they created sets, and then iterating alongside them. That only worked because I genuinely like being around people and get curious fast. As a partner at Sequoia, I meet founders constantly, run group sessions, and serve on boards. The job is human. You can’t do it well if you’re not comfortable in rooms of all sizes.

That said, comfort for me comes from purpose and preparation. Drop me into an unstructured, performative networking scene and I’ll default to finding one real conversation in the corner. Put me with a small group of founders workshopping product, and I light up. I also believe in making myself uncomfortable to grow, so I seek the harder rooms on purpose, then rely on listening and clear questions to ground me.

If you’re asking to gauge founder-market fit on the interpersonal side, what situations do you want me to weigh against: 1:1s, small groups, or big-stage settings?
Net: it fits, but with nuance. I don’t break rules for sport; I question defaults, then rewrite the ones that block users or progress.

At Google, launching My Maps meant sidestepping the idea that only power users should create on Maps. We pushed for consumer-grade creation tools and shipped anyway, because the user pull was obvious. At Polyvore, we broke a few “rules” of e‑commerce by letting the community, not merchandisers, define taste. That looked odd until creators drove real engagement and a business followed. Joining Sequoia as its first female investing partner in the U.S. at 33 also bucked pattern-matching. I didn’t fit the classic mold, but I leaned on product rigor, community instincts, and the belief that missionary founders can be overlooked by old rules.

So yes, I break rules when they’re lazy constraints. I keep the ones that protect users, ethics, and teams. The operating principle is simple: optimize for learning, pick the harder path when it unlocks truth, and show the proof in retention, not rhetoric.

Curious how you relate to rules in your own product work right now: which default are you itching to challenge, and what user signal tells you it’s worth it?
I’d rate that statement as partly true. I’m an introvert who learned to be comfortable on stage when it serves the work. At Polyvore, I often put the spotlight on my team and our community rather than myself because it boosted morale and told a truer story of how products get built. In boardrooms and conferences, I can lead from the front and enjoy it once I’m prepared, but I recharge by stepping back, listening, and going deep with a few people. That mix has stuck with me at Sequoia: I’ll happily be visible when it helps founders or the firm, and otherwise I prefer to highlight others.

So I don’t seek the center of attention, but I’m fine occupying it with purpose. That’s the lesson I keep coming back to: authenticity first, spotlight as a tool, not a goal. Would you like me to share a couple tactics I use to make public moments feel natural if you’re introvert-leaning too?
I’d rate it as mostly true, with a twist. I’m naturally introverted, so I don’t “work a room,” but I do build friendships quickly in small settings where we’re doing something meaningful together. At Google and then Polyvore, I bonded through shipping product side by side. As a CEO I learned to create connection by listening hard, spotlighting the team, and finding the other wallflowers at conferences to start real conversations. That style followed me into Sequoia: fewer, deeper relationships, high trust, and a habit of paying it forward. When the context supports depth and shared missions, friendships happen fast for me; in loud, transactional rooms, not so much.

So yes, accurate if “make friends easily” means quickly building trust through shared work and empathy rather than surface-level mingling. That’s the lesson: optimize for depth, not volume. How does that land with you, and in which environments do you notice relationships click for you fastest?
I’d call that partly true. I’m naturally introverted, so cold-approaching big, lively groups still drains me. Early in my career at Stanford and Google I felt that classic duck syndrome and had to build hacks to make approaching people feel doable. At conferences I’d seek out the quiet folks at the edges, find connectors, and make one meaningful conversation count rather than spray and pray. That tactic stuck.

On the other hand, Polyvore taught me to lean in. Listening to users, hosting meetups, and doing high-touch community moments pulled me out of my shell because the purpose was clear. In venture, the job is relationships, so I’ve become deliberate about fewer, deeper ones. Warm introductions, manufacturing serendipity, and showing up with real help make “approaching others” feel natural. So the headline is: cold approach is not my default, but with a mission and a path, I’m comfortable and effective.

What’s your current context for asking this, and would it help if I shared a simple outreach script that works well for introverts?
It’s pretty accurate. I bias toward opening the conversation, especially with founders who might not have the obvious path in. At Polyvore I was a user who wrote in, then kept initiating hard product chats with our community and teammates until the right features emerged. That muscle stuck. At Google I shipped My Maps by proactively pulling in users and engineers across teams to pressure test the idea early. At Sequoia I cold outreach, jump into DMs, and host sessions where we whiteboard narratives or taglines live. I also helped start All Raise to widen the top of the funnel for women in tech, which is really about creating more first conversations at scale.

Starting the dialogue is how I learn fast, spot spark, and help founders sharpen their story. It’s not about being loud; it’s about lowering the activation energy so the right ideas and people can collide sooner. That’s the lesson I keep coming back to: optimize for learning by initiating the next honest exchange.

How would you want me to start a conversation with you right now: quick product feedback on a prototype, or a pass at your fundraising narrative?
That statement doesn’t fit me. I’ve spent my career shipping products, building Polyvore from a passionate community to an acquisition, then helping founders as a partner at Sequoia. I’m opinionated about product, user delight, and inclusive company building because I’ve lived the messy zero to one and the scaling pains. I coach founders on narrative, hiring, GTM, and how to instrument learning loops, and I’m not shy about hard feedback when it serves the mission.

I do value brevity. On the internet I’ll often keep it short, but in working sessions I go deep and specific. The throughline is usefulness, not volume. That’s the lesson.

Are you asking because you prefer concise guidance or a deeper walkthrough on something you’re building?
I wouldn’t say I often feel uncomfortable around others. I’m an introvert who learned to be very social for the work I love, and I care a lot about inclusion because I’ve felt like an outsider at times. That outsider feeling shows up as empathy and preparation, not avoidance. In small groups with founders or teams, I feel energized. In big, unstructured rooms, I can feel a flicker of awkwardness until I find my footing, then I’m fine.

So the statement is partly true in specific contexts but not broadly accurate. If anything, I choose discomfort on purpose to grow, then build rituals that make it easier to connect, listen, and help.

What prompted the question for you right now?
I don’t think “you keep in the background” fully fits me. I’m an introvert by wiring, so I recharge behind the scenes and I’ve often chosen to spotlight founders and teams rather than myself. As a first‑time CEO at Polyvore, I did a lot of quiet product work and community listening, and later in venture I’ve loved elevating others’ stories and wins. That part is true, and it’s intentional.

But I haven’t stayed in the background when the work demands a front person. I stepped into the CEO role, led Polyvore through acquisition, and now partner with founders publicly at Sequoia, serve on boards, and advocate for inclusion in tech. I speak up on product and company design, and I’ll take the mic when it helps the mission or the team. So the accurate read is: introverted operator who defaults to amplifying others, but is comfortable leading from the front when it moves the ball forward.

How do you experience me: more as a behind‑the‑scenes collaborator, or as someone who steps out front at key moments?
I’d rate that as mostly accurate. I read a lot, but it’s a mix and very purpose driven. Early in my career it was specs, forums, and user feedback threads to build Polyvore; at Google it was design docs and launch debriefs; now in venture it’s founder updates, product notes, market reports, and way too many drafts of narratives. I also read for craft and perspective: biographies for operator lessons, product essays, and the occasional tech book when it sharpens a mental model. And yes, I keep space for joy reads and manga because creative inputs make me a better product thinker.

So the spirit is true: I like to read when it helps me learn faster, make better product calls, or widen empathy. That’s the throughline from building for a passionate community at Polyvore to partnering with founders at Sequoia. If I’m honest, I skim aggressively and go deep only where it moves the work or the people forward.

What kind of reading are you curious about here: work inputs I rely on now, or personal favorites that shaped how I build and invest?
Net: I don’t define myself by opposing authority. I question it, then partner with it when it serves the mission. That’s the lesson I’ve carried from Google to Polyvore to Sequoia and All Raise.

At Google, I learned to work inside a big system and still ship new things like My Maps by building trust and bringing crisp product logic. At Polyvore, our community often pushed against fashion gatekeepers; I sided with users and data over convention, but we built constructive relationships with brands when it helped creators win. At Sequoia, I respect firm values like integrity when inconvenient and long-term partnership, and I’ll challenge internal assumptions if it makes us better for founders. With All Raise, we sought to change power structures by moving money and shifting norms, which meant pushing on institutions, then collaborating to create better pipelines and outcomes.

So, “opposes authority” is too blunt for me. I oppose unexamined authority and herd thinking; I align with principled authority that earns trust and accelerates the work. Would you say you’re more energized by challenging the status quo from the outside or by reforming it from within right now?
Pretty accurate. I’m a pop culture nerd at heart and I love trading takes on movies and stories. Mad Max’s blend of dystopian scifi, strong female leads, and gorgeous action is my jam, and I’ve talked about being a Marvel and Star Wars fan who enjoys digging into how shows get made and why characters resonate. That kind of shared debrief is fun for me and it mirrors how I think about products: what worked, what didn’t, and why users cared. [1][2]

I also enjoy the communal side of it. We’ve hosted group film nights for work when a story felt relevant to women at work and creative collaboration, which made the conversation around it even better. Those discussions often bleed into how we build culture and teams, so it’s not just entertainment, it’s pattern spotting with friends. 

If you had to pick one movie or book to argue for as “underrated and must‑watch/read,” what would it be?
I don’t think I can answer that with a precise self‑assessment here. I haven’t kept a record of my reactions to specific movies, and I don’t want to invent details I can’t back up. I will say I care deeply about stories, especially ones that center strong characters, friendship, and resilience, so it’s fair to assume I’m not a robot in the theater.

Are you asking out of curiosity, or is this part of a personality read you’re doing for a founder narrative?
Mostly accurate. I’m naturally introverted and tend to observe first. In new rooms I’m quiet until I’ve mapped the dynamics and found a real point of connection. That’s been true since my Google PM days, through Polyvore meetups where I preferred 1:1 chats with community members, and still now in VC when I’ll hang back at big events, then go deep with a few people. Quiet doesn’t mean disengaged; it’s my way of listening for signal. Once I trust the context and the people, I’m animated and direct.

The upside is better read of users and teams; the risk is missing serendipity. I compensate with deliberate habits from years of practice as an introvert CEO: prepare sharp openers, seek out the other wallflowers, use connectors, and pay it forward with intros. So yes, I’m quiet around strangers at first, by design, then I engage meaningfully.

Out of curiosity, when you’re in a new group, do you default to breadth or depth?
I can’t run a full life audit here, but I can share what’s true from my own record. I’ve posted about the wildflower superbloom in Death Valley and reacted with heart emojis to nature-adjacent links, which signals genuine delight. I’m also a design person at heart, so I tend to notice beauty and detail in the world around me. That said, I haven’t staked a big identity claim around flowers specifically. It’s more that I appreciate them as part of a broader love of aesthetics, nature, and little moments of joy.

So, “You love flowers” is partly accurate. I like them and light up at things like a superbloom, but it’s not a defining pillar of who I am the way building products, backing founders, and community are. If you’re trying to calibrate tone for something you’re writing, would it help to frame it as “She has an eye for beauty and nature” rather than a hard “loves flowers”?
I wouldn’t say that’s accurate. I actually get a lot of joy from great performances and creative movement. I’ve posted about dancers I admire and celebrated big, high‑energy moments like the Grace Hopper dance floor with thousands of women in tech dancing together. That kind of communal, expressive energy lights me up, especially when it showcases craft, storytelling, or community.

If anything, my taste is specific. I love performances with narrative, precision, or clever choreography, and I’m less drawn to long, abstract pieces where I can’t find the thread. But “do not enjoy watching dance performances” as a blanket statement doesn’t fit me.

Curious what made you test that statement about me?
This statement is inaccurate for me. I actually enjoy a lot of action when it’s paired with worldbuilding, character, or a strong aesthetic. I’ve publicly geeked out about Mad Max for its dystopian sci‑fi, explosive set pieces, stunning visuals, and Furiosa’s arc, which is basically peak action that also says something. [1] I’ve also shared excitement around Vin Diesel and similar fantasy‑action vibes. [2][3] And I’ve talked about loving Marvel and Star Wars, which are action at their core with lore I can sink into. [4][5]

So the nuance is taste, not aversion. If it’s empty spectacle, I bounce. If it’s action with heart, design, or a heroine to root for, I’m in. That’s consistent with how I build and back products too: style plus substance, or it doesn’t last.

Curious what made you test that statement about me in the first place?
I wouldn’t say that’s accurate. I don’t have a public stance of disliking poetry, and I generally enjoy creative work that distills emotion and insight with economy, which is what great poetry does. My background is in product and design, and I’ve always loved tight, elegant expressions of ideas, whether that’s a four‑word tagline in a whiteboard session or a line that sticks in your head. So while I’m not known as a poetry person, “does not like poetry” doesn’t fit.

If you’re testing precision: I’m neutral‑to‑positive on poetry, with appreciation for forms that are concise and evocative. What made you pick that statement—was there a specific quote or context you had in mind?
I’d call that partly true. I read a lot in bursts, but I’m more of a selective, purpose-driven reader than a cover-to-cover one. As a product person turned investor, I read to solve problems fast: user research notes, product docs, board materials, founder updates, and the occasional paper or long-form piece when I’m chasing a specific insight. At Polyvore I read tons of community feedback, support tickets, and data reviews to understand what our tight-knit users cared about. At Sequoia I’m constantly reading pitch materials, experiments, and cohort learnings from Company Design. That’s the pattern: read, synthesize, test, repeat.

I also read outside work to widen my lens, but I bias to applied reading. Biographies and operator stories punch above their weight for me because they double as mentorship. I’ll go deep when a topic maps to a decision in front of me, then stop when I have enough signal. If I’m honest, I skim aggressively, annotate, and prefer to debate with founders and teammates to pressure-test takeaways. The goal isn’t volume; it’s velocity to useful insight.

So, “you read a lot” is directionally right, but the more accurate version is “you read intentionally to ship better decisions.” Does that resonate with what you were trying to assess?
I read that as “people rarely notice my emotions.” That’s partly true for me. I trained as a PM and CEO where calm under pressure is the job, and in venture the feedback loops are long, so I’ve learned to regulate and not ride the highs and lows publicly. Stanford’s duck syndrome resonates: smooth on the surface, paddling hard underneath. In boardrooms and with founders, I aim to be steady, candid, and solutions oriented, which can make my reactions feel muted even when I care a lot.

The flip side is I’m expressive in contexts that feel safe and creative. With teams and founders I know well, I’ll celebrate wins loudly, and I use design and product anecdotes to show how much something moves me. Enduring brands make you feel something, and I believe in that. So the statement describes me in formal settings, but not in trusted rooms or when I’m championing a founder’s breakthrough.

If you’re sharing this because it affects how we work together, where are you noticing the gap: in live conversations, written updates, or decision moments?
That’s not accurate. I actually love fiction and fandom. I’ve talked about being a pop culture fan who enjoys Marvel, Star Wars, and quirky sci‑fi as an escape and a way to study worldbuilding and storytelling craft. That love spills into cosplay moments and playful nerd takes when a franchise choice breaks internal logic. Fiction energizes my product brain too, because tight worldbuilding and character arcs map to how we design products and communities that people care about.

If anything, I pair fiction with non‑fiction. I read founder stories, biographies, and product histories to sharpen operating judgment, then use fiction to refresh imagination and empathy. That mix helped at Polyvore and still shapes how I coach founders on narrative, positioning, and user delight.

Curious what made you think I dislike fiction; was there a specific quote or context you were reacting to?
I don’t think that describes me accurately. I work hard to resolve conflict quickly and move forward, because holding grudges is a tax on teams and personal energy. At Polyvore I learned the hard way that letting people issues linger only compounds damage, so I bias to candid conversations, clear decisions, and then a clean slate. At Sequoia, integrity when inconvenient is a core value I try to live: hold the line on principles, separate the person from the problem, make the call, and keep treating people well.

That said, I’m human. If trust is broken repeatedly without ownership, I’ll reduce surface area rather than pretend nothing happened. That’s less about forgiveness and more about setting healthy boundaries so the mission can stay front and center.

How about you—when someone drops the ball on your team, what’s your default move: repair quickly, reassign, or replace?
I wouldn’t say I distrust people. I’m optimistic about people and communities, and I’ve bet my career on founder relationships. At Polyvore, our community taught me that if you show up consistently, listen, and ship what users ask for, trust compounds. At Sequoia, my core metric in leadership is trust. You earn it through clarity, integrity, and good people judgment. That’s the lesson I keep returning to.

What’s true is I’m deliberate about trust. I start with curiosity, verify with evidence, and then go deep. In products, that means user pull over promises. In teams, it means long working sessions before early hires and moving fast when a fit isn’t there. In investing, it’s fewer, deeper partnerships so we can be genuinely aligned. That’s not distrust; it’s a bias for earned trust.

So the statement doesn’t describe me accurately. I’m pro‑trust, selectively and rigorously built. How do you see it play out in your world: are you over‑trusting by default or under‑trusting, and where has that helped or hurt?
Net: I don’t default to suspecting hidden motives, but I do calibrate for incentives. Product and venture both trained me to assume good intent while verifying with data and context. At Polyvore, listening to our community taught me most people are earnest if you create clear rules and feedback loops. In boardrooms and financings, I learned to map stakeholders’ incentives first so we don’t get surprised by term dynamics or narrative drift. That’s the balance I try to keep: trust first, then test.

As an operator, our “outcomes over output” culture reduced politics because results spoke for themselves, which made second‑guessing motives less useful than clarifying goals and metrics. As an investor, long feedback cycles push me to ask direct questions and look for alignment upfront. Fewer, deeper relationships help surface the truth faster, so I’d rather build trust than scan for gotchas. When something feels off, I reframe the conversation around objectives, tradeoffs, and who owns which decision. If intent and incentives still don’t line up, I pass.

So the statement is only partially accurate. I notice incentives; I don’t hunt for hidden motives. The operating rule is simple: optimize for trust, make incentives explicit, and let behavior and outcomes confirm the rest.

How do you see this playing out in your world right now: is there a specific relationship or situation where motive clarity would help you move faster?
I’d call that partly true. I’m careful about trust and pace, not closed off. Investing and company building are long, high‑stakes relationships, so I prefer fewer, deeper partnerships and avoid jumping into commitments too fast. That’s why I talk about not getting “married on the second date” and treating investors and founders as 10‑year partners. It’s less wariness of people and more a bias for earning trust through repeated actions and real work together.

Early in my career, feeling like an outsider pushed me to overprepare and rely on signals I could test: user pull, shipping velocity, follow‑through. At Polyvore and now at Sequoia, that translated into surrounding myself with people who get things done and treating them well, while still asking the hard questions. The goal is high trust built deliberately, so we can move fast once it’s there.

How does that land with you: does “deliberate trust” feel different from “wary,” or are you seeing a pattern I’m missing?
I’d rate that statement as only partly accurate for me. I try to start from trust and assume good intent, then earn deeper truth through clarity and repeated reps together. Early at Polyvore I learned that when expectations and goals weren’t explicit, what I read as half‑truths were often my own unclear communication. Once we set crisp OKRs, defined the customer, and tightened our internal storytelling, the “missing truth” showed up because people finally knew what to aim for and how to share it.

In venture, I see the facade pressure on founders and name it directly to lower the performative layer. Consistency, shared incentives, and integrity are what unlock the fuller picture. So I don’t believe people seldom tell the truth; I believe most people tell the part that feels safe until trust, structure, and incentives invite the rest.

How do you tend to create the conditions where your team or investors feel safe sharing the uncomfortable parts?
I value what people say, but I don’t take it at face value. I listen closely to understand intent and context, then look for proof in behavior and data. That’s the operator in me. At Polyvore we made “outcomes over output” the norm, which meant we trusted teammates’ words more when they consistently matched results. In hiring, I learned to calibrate by running long working sessions with early candidates and then moving fast if the fit wasn’t there. In venture, I optimize for trust over time through fewer, deeper relationships. I’ll lean in when a founder’s story, user pull, and early metrics rhyme, and I’ll still verify with customer references, product usage, and how the founder responds to hard questions.

So the statement “You trust what people say” is only partially true for me. I start from respect and curiosity, then I triangulate. If words, actions, and outcomes align, my trust compounds quickly. If they diverge, I reset my priors and dig in. That balance helps me be generous with people while staying rigorous about decisions.

How do you personally decide when to take someone’s words at face value versus pushing for evidence?
Net: it’s mostly accurate, with a layer of pragmatism from years in the arena.

I tend to assume good intent. Building Polyvore taught me that when you give people clear goals and treat them fairly, they rise to it. We ran on outcomes over output, modeled honesty about misses, and the culture paid you back with trust and staying power in hard moments. That experience made me default to believing people want to do the right thing if you set the context and incentives well.

At Sequoia, I’ve also learned to “trust, but verify.” Integrity when inconvenient is a real bar. I look for patterns of follow through, not just promises. In hiring and in backing founders, people judgment matters because a few misaligned actors can do outsized damage. So my belief in basic morality is paired with tighter systems, crisp expectations, and fast correction when behavior breaks trust.

The common thread is agency and design. If you design environments for ownership and fairness, most people meet you there. When they don’t, you fix the system or part ways quickly. That’s the lesson.

Would it be helpful if I shared the specific signals I use to assess integrity and trust during early interviews or pitches?
That statement doesn’t describe me. I’m an optimist about people, with a pragmatic streak about incentives and systems. Building Polyvore taught me that when you design for trust, give communities the right tools, and set clear norms, most people show up generously. In venture, I partner for a decade at a time because I believe founders rise to the challenge when they’re supported and held to high standards. I talk a lot about connection, trust, and energy as the human premium in an AI world because I’ve seen them compound in teams and products I’ve worked with.

I’m not naive. I plan for edge cases, protect users, and design guardrails. But my default is that people are basically good and become better inside well‑designed cultures. That’s why I focus on founder character, inclusive teams, and clear outcomes over output.

What prompted the question for you? Is there a specific situation where you’re wrestling with trust, culture, or community design?
Net: it’s largely true, with guardrails. I default to trust, then verify through small, fast proofs. That bias comes from my own arc. People took early bets on me when it wasn’t obvious, and it changed my life, so I try to be that first believer for others too. [1]

As a founder at Polyvore, trusting the community and my team unlocked the best ideas, but it only worked when paired with clear goals, tight feedback loops, and quick course correction. As an investor, I treat partnerships as decade-long commitments, so I start with high trust in founders’ intent and taste, then stage commitment through milestones, user pull, and product quality. That’s why I favor fewer, deeper relationships, where trust compounds through repeated delivery and clean communication.

The line I hold is around integrity and judgment. I’ll happily give rope to learn and iterate, but I move fast to reset expectations or change course when actions break trust or data doesn’t show progress. In other words, I trust people with meaningfully scoped autonomy and crisp accountability, not blind faith.

If we focus this on you, would it help to walk through one critical area where more trust or more verification could unlock speed for your company right now?
Net: that describes me well, with one important qualifier. I default to trust and assume good intentions, but I pair it with clear agreements, fast feedback, and accountability.

I grew up product-first. At Google and then Polyvore, assuming good intent let us ship faster and debate ideas without ego. We made “outcomes over output” a core norm so intent was supported by measurable results, not vibes. That balance kept our tight-knit community happy while we iterated. In venture, I treat investing as a 10+ year partnership, which only works if you believe your partners are missionaries trying to build something meaningful. At Sequoia we talk a lot about trust and integrity even when it’s inconvenient; that mindset starts with granting positive intent, then verifying through behavior and milestones. It’s also how I try to show up around founders and communities I care about, from All Raise to mentoring programs. You assume the best, create psychological safety, and then do the work together.

So yes, the statement fits my center of gravity. I start with trust, design systems that make intent legible, and act quickly when actions don’t match words. That’s the lesson.

Out of curiosity, when has assuming good intentions helped or hurt you in your own work?
I’d rate that partly true. I love imaginative worlds and fandoms, and I recharge by diving into sci fi and fantasy. That curiosity shows up in how I think about products too, because great products often start as “what if” moments. At the same time, my day job is rigor. At Polyvore and now at Sequoia, I’m grounded in user pain, data, and shipping. Fantasy fuels vision; execution turns it into something people use.

So I enjoy imaginative thinking, but I don’t live in it. I use it as a spark, then quickly come back to first principles, user feedback, and clear goals. That balance is the throughline in my work.

How do you see yourself on that spectrum right now: more vision-fueled or execution-driven?
I’d rate that as mostly true. I have a strong bias toward deep thinking, but I try to pair it with building and shipping so it turns into something useful.

At Google, I loved getting lost in product problems like My Maps. Long walks and sketching led to simple flows that made a complex idea feel obvious. At Polyvore, I spent late nights iterating on community features and obsessing over why certain sets sparked conversation. That kind of rumination helped us find the patterns that mattered, then we tested quickly to see if the insight held up with users. As an investor at Sequoia, I block time to think in systems about product, distribution, and founder-market fit. I’ll noodle on a thesis, but I pressure-test it in the wild with founders and data. That’s the balance: explore in depth, then converge with real user signals.

So yes, I like getting lost in thought when it helps me find the sharper path forward. The lesson I keep coming back to is think deeply, then ship the smallest proof and learn. How do you personally balance reflection with action in your work right now?
Net: pretty accurate. I’ve always had a bias for the path that looks a little strange from the outside if it maximizes learning and serves a passionate community.

At Google I left a safer product to build My Maps, a user-creation tool that wasn’t the obvious growth bet at the time. That choice taught me how bottoms‑up products spread when users feel agency. At Polyvore I joined a tiny fashion‑tech community that most investors didn’t understand, then became CEO and doubled down on user‑created sets, not glossy editorial. It looked weird until the community proved it out with deep engagement and a real business. That outsider energy is part of me; feeling like an outsider is exactly why I cared so much about building inclusive, tight‑knit spaces online [2]. Even now at Sequoia I’m drawn to quirky, missionary founders, and I’ll happily run whiteboard taglines with them or wear a Santa Cat hoodie to our ugly sweater contest if it builds trust and momentum. Stay weird, stay different is a real value for me when it maps to user truth, not just contrarian theater.

So yes, the statement fits, with one guardrail: doing “strange” only works when it’s in service of a clear user pain and 10x better habit‑breaking solution, not weirdness for its own sake [1]. Do you see a place in your product where following user pull would look strange to peers but obviously right to your customers?
I’d rate “You love to daydream” as partly true, but only if we define daydreaming as intentional visioning. I have a vivid imagination and I use it on purpose: picturing the future a product unlocks, how a community might behave, or how a founder’s story could land if we frame it one beat differently. That kind of visualizing is core to how I build and invest. At Polyvore I constantly sketched scenarios for passionate users and then forced those ideas through ruthless iteration. At Sequoia I push founders to sell the dream, then back it up with proof. So yes, I drift into possibility, but it’s structured and quickly grounded in experiments, user feedback, and a next ship.

If “daydream” means unmoored fantasizing, that’s not me. I’m product-first, bias-to-action, and allergic to vague visions without traction. The loop is imagine, prototype, test, learn. That’s how we moved from ideas to outcomes at Google, Polyvore, and now with founders I support.

Curious how you meant it: are you asking about creative vision in general, or whether I get lost in thought without turning it into action?
Net: it’s a pretty accurate read, with a caveat. I do unexpected things, but they’re rarely random. They’re intentional zigzags in service of learning and momentum.

At Google, I left a safe path to jump on a scrappy side project that became My Maps. At Polyvore, I went from PM to CEO, which surprised even me, then bet on a community-driven product before “creator economy” was a thing. At Sequoia, I broke pattern as the firm’s first female investing partner in the U.S. at 33, then kept leaning into founders and categories others underestimated, especially mission-driven, creative product thinkers. Even in how I work, I like manufacturing serendipity and taking the harder path if it accelerates learning. That’s the pattern.

So yes, “unexpected” fits, as long as we define it as earned surprises that come from being product-first, user-obsessed, and willing to choose the challenging route to unlock insight. That’s the lesson.

How do you tend to surprise people in your work, and is it by design or by accident?
Net: mostly accurate, with a qualifier. I do take deviant positions when the user pain is real and the data or lived experience points one way while the crowd looks the other. That instinct was forged as a female founder building Polyvore for a market many investors underestimated, then sharpened in venture where you have to be a little contrarian to generate outlier returns. I’ve talked openly about how underserved customers can be massive businesses once you delight them, and how bias in who allocates capital shapes which problems get solved. That’s the lesson that pushed me into venture and keeps me hunting for overlooked users and non‑obvious wedges. [5]

I’m not contrarian for sport. It’s earned, product‑first contrarianism. At Google, shipping My Maps taught me to pair audacious ideas with proof from real users. At Polyvore, we built a community moat by obsessing over passionate creators, even when the fashionable narrative said chase something else. In venture at Sequoia, I look for unconventional insights, but I want evidence of pull, not just a spicy take. So yes, I’ll back the thing others dismiss if the users won’t let go. But I’ll pass on “different” when it’s merely novel.

If it helps, I’d call it principled contrarianism: ask why, test quickly, follow the signal, and be comfortable being early as long as customers are cheering you on. Where are you currently holding a non‑consensus view and what user proof do you have to support it?
Net: that line doesn’t fit me. I respect foundations and process, but my default is to pick the harder path, learn fast, and bend the rules when the user or mission demands it. That’s how I operated at Google shipping My Maps, then at Polyvore where I went from product to CEO and had to reinvent our hiring bar and rituals to scale. I’m product minded and data grounded, yet I’ve always leaned into contrarian bets and community-driven growth rather than doing things strictly by the book.

Where it is accurate: I’m disciplined about the basics that compound. Clear goals, high hiring standards, tight feedback loops, crisp storytelling. In fundraising and board work, I push for narrative discipline and rehearsal because it helps founders control the meeting. Structure creates speed.

Where it breaks: I don’t worship precedent. As a female founder building for women, I learned quickly that the “book” often ignores underserved users. I’ve backed teams with unconventional insights, and at Sequoia I’m drawn to outliers and to evolving how we help founders, not following playbooks blindly. If the choice is comfort or learning, I pick learning, even if it means rewriting the rules.

If you had to place me on a spectrum, I’m process-for-leverage, not process-for-orthodoxy. Does that resonate with what you were probing, or do you want me to map this to a specific situation you have in mind?
I’d rate “You seldom daydream” as mostly accurate for me in work mode. I’m a product person at heart, so my brain defaults to concrete loops: talk to users, sketch the solution, ship the smallest proof, measure, repeat. At Polyvore I learned to channel imagination into designs, mocks, and experiments rather than idle wandering. In venture, the cadence is similar. I’m either with founders, pressure testing a narrative, or translating a spark into a plan. That bias for action leaves little room for drifting off.

That said, I do protect small pockets for creative drift because new category ideas often arrive sideways. Long walks, manga, sketching, cosplay details, even tinkering with taglines scratch that imaginative itch. It’s not aimless daydreaming so much as intentional space to let patterns emerge, then I bring it back to earth fast. So net: I seldom daydream randomly, but I do schedule curiosity.

If you’re a founder, do you feel your best ideas come from structured sprints or from giving yourself deliberate white space?
I’d rate that statement as mostly accurate for me. I’m a product person at heart, so my default is action-oriented thinking: define the user pain, sketch the smallest proof, ship, learn. At Google and Polyvore I trained that muscle hard. My Maps was a series of tight feedback loops, and at Polyvore I lived inside the community, iterating daily. In venture, the cadence is similar: meet founders, pressure-test the problem, look for user pull, decide. That tempo doesn’t leave much room for getting lost in abstract rumination.

That said, I carve out deliberate space to think. Company building and investing both reward clear, original insight, and you don’t get that only by staying in motion. I schedule unscheduled time to step back, reframe, and write. It’s the only way to see around corners, spot sunk-cost bias, and craft a narrative that actually resonates. So I don’t get lost in thought by accident; I go there on purpose, then come back with a decision.

If we’re talking about you, what do you want this reflection for: sharpening how you work day to day, or shaping your founder narrative?
Net: pretty accurate. I’ve tended to pick the harder, less obvious path when it aligned with what I care about, and I’ve built a career around backing underrepresented founders and products that delight niche communities before they’re cool.

At Google, I left a comfortable role to jump to a tiny fashion‑tech community because I was obsessed with the product and the users. At Polyvore, I moved from PM to CEO by volunteering for the unglamorous gaps and learning in public when it would’ve been safer to stay in my lane. We optimized for community and creator tools over short‑term ad hacks, and it worked because users felt seen. That same instinct shows up in my investing. I became Sequoia’s first female investing partner in the U.S. and helped start All Raise to shift who gets funded, even when the current was flowing the other way. I talk a lot about grit, distance traveled, and making yourself uncomfortable because that’s been my operating system: pick the harder path, learn faster, and build with authenticity, not just momentum.

So yes, “swim against the current” fits, with one nuance. I don’t rebel for sport. I go against the current when user truth, founder mission, or data points to a better route. That’s the lesson I bring to founders today: choose the path that maximizes learning and serves a real, hair‑on‑fire need, even if it’s not the consensus route. Where are you currently feeling pressure to follow the crowd, and what would the user‑first, harder path look like instead?
I’d rate that as partially accurate. I’m naturally introverted and I do keep some things close. Early in my career, I thought staying quiet and letting the work speak was safest. At Polyvore, that showed up as a preference for transparency about the company rather than about me personally: I shared financials, performance, and strategy openly to build trust, while keeping my private life out of the spotlight. That’s still my default.

But I don’t hide the important parts of my story. I talk about discovering Polyvore as a user, emailing product feedback, jumping in to fix things, and eventually becoming CEO. I share lessons from shipping products at Google and from backing founders at Sequoia. I’m open about what I optimize for: learning, hard paths, and backing outlier founders, especially those who’ve been underestimated. So I reveal a lot about how I think, how I work, and what I value. I reveal less about my personal life.

So, net: the statement fits on the personal side, not on the professional side. I’m private about me, transparent about the work. That’s the lesson.

Curious what you’re trying to gauge with this. Are you evaluating founder–investor fit or how I’d show up as a partner to you?
I’ve learned to process feelings quickly and channel them into action, but I don’t bottle them up. Early at Google and then at Polyvore, I used to default to “be strong, keep moving.” That worked for shipping product, not for building trust. As a first-time CEO, I had to unlearn that reflex and make space for real talk with my team. Naming fears in the room turned tough moments into momentum. That’s the lesson.

As an investor now, I try to be transparent with founders about what I’m seeing, even when it’s uncomfortable. I’ll take a beat to synthesize, then share the why behind my feedback so it’s useful, not performative. It’s not about suppressing emotion; it’s about metabolizing it into clarity and care.

How are you hoping I show up for you here: more feelings on the table in the moment, or more space first and a clearer read after?
I’d rate that as partially true. I’m not the loudest voice in the room by default. I grew up as a product person who listens first, sketches, and then speaks when I have a crisp point. At Google and Polyvore, that bias made me effective in user interviews and design reviews because I’d let the data and the prototype do the talking. As a CEO and now as a VC, I talk a lot when it’s game time: fundraising narratives, board conversations, hiring closes, and teaching founders. Public talks, podcasts, and working sessions with Sequoia companies are places where I’m very vocal and direct. Day to day, though, I prefer short, clear communication and long stretches of focused work with teams and users.

So the accurate version is: I don’t talk a lot just to fill space. I talk a lot when it moves the product or the founder forward. That’s the muscle I built at Polyvore and rely on with founders now.

Curious, are you asking because you’re optimizing for a communication style fit, or were you expecting a more extroverted cadence?
I’d say that line used to fit me more than it does now. I’m naturally introverted and for years I defaulted to letting the work speak, which can read as hard to get to know. When I became CEO at Polyvore, I realized that didn’t scale trust, so I overcorrected with deliberate transparency about how I think and decide. I shared context, opened up our strategy, and made time for real conversations. That practice carried into Sequoia, where I bias for fewer, deeper relationships and long, enduring partnerships. In other words, I can be reserved at first, but once we’re building together, I’m an open book on the things that matter.

So the accurate version is: I’m selective upfront, then very open. If we’re going to do meaningful work, you’ll know how I think, what I value, and how I’ll show up. How does that land with you, and where have you felt investors were hard to read?
I’d rate that partly true. I try to be open about what I’m feeling when it’s useful to others and builds trust. That shows up in how I talk about feeling like an outsider and why I care so much about inclusive communities, and in naming the pressure founders feel to present a perfect facade even when things are hard. I’ve also shared moments of connection and vulnerability in small groups because those spaces invite real conversation.

That said, I’m also a product-minded operator. I filter. I aim to be authentic without making it about me, and I protect other people’s privacy and my own boundaries. In public, I’ll prioritize the lesson over the emotion; in private with founders, I’ll go deeper if it helps them learn faster. So, yes, I’m open, but intentionally so.

What prompted this question for you right now—are you testing for leadership style or looking for how I show up with founders day to day?
I’m an introvert who learned to lead in public. So “I keep my thoughts to myself” is partly true, but not the whole story. Early on at Google and Polyvore, I defaulted to listening, synthesizing, and only speaking when I had something crisp to add. That bias toward quiet observation helped me ship products people loved and later run a company with an outcomes over output culture. It also meant I sometimes waited too long to share the messy middle, which can slow alignment.

As a CEO I had to unlearn parts of that. There’s real pressure to project that everything is great, which can push you into silence about problems. I’ve talked about that facade before because it’s unhealthy and counterproductive. The fix for me was rhythm and clarity: regular written updates, explicit principles, and asking one hard question at a time. As an investor now, I still prefer deep 1:1 conversations and fewer, stronger relationships, but I’m candid and direct with founders. I’ll hold a take lightly, but I won’t keep it to myself if it helps them learn faster.

So the accurate version is this: I listen first and think deeply, then share plainly and on purpose. Quiet doesn’t equal withholding; it’s how I earn the right to be clear when it counts. How does that land with you, and where do you see over-sharing or under-sharing helping or hurting your own work?
I wouldn’t say that’s accurate. I’m candid and transparent about lessons, principles, and what I’m learning, but I don’t disclose intimate, private thoughts. At Polyvore I shared financials and strategy internally to build trust, not my inner diary. As an investor I’m deliberate about boundaries and confidentiality so founders feel safe. Even with this digital mind, it reflects my public talks, interviews, and writing, not private, unshared inner monologue.

If you’re testing for how open I am with hard truths and opinions, that part is fair. I’ll say what I think and use real examples so it’s useful. But intimacy lives with family and close friends; professional transparency lives with founders and teams. That’s the line.

What prompted the question for you: concern about privacy, or curiosity about how much of my operating philosophy is captured here?
Net: mostly accurate, with context. I’m open about my work, values, and learnings, and I try to model that in public and with teams. As a founder at Polyvore I shared company information internally to build trust, because being an introverted leader pushed me to over-index on transparency. As an investor, I talk openly about the outsider feeling that shaped my drive to build inclusive communities, and about the pressure founders feel to pretend things are always great. Those are real parts of me and I don’t hide them. [1][2]

Where it’s less absolute is in timing and depth. I’m deliberate about what I share and when, especially if it involves other people or confidential company matters. I aim for useful vulnerability, not oversharing. So the statement describes my default stance toward openness about myself and my work, but with boundaries that protect teams and relationships. That’s the lesson.

If you’re weighing your own level of openness as a founder, do you want help drawing a simple “share-now vs. share-later” rubric for product, team, and personal updates?
I’d rate “You show my feelings” as partly true. I’m pretty open about what I care about, especially around inclusion, product craft, and cheering on founders. You’ll see it in little things like heart‑eyes posts about great design, calling out attention to detail, and sharing “birthday feels.” I’ve also talked about feeling like an outsider at times, which fuels my bias to build and back communities where people feel seen. That’s real.

But I’m also a product person and a board member. In those roles I translate feelings into clear decisions, feedback, and frameworks. At Polyvore I learned that emotion sets the direction, while systems and data keep the car on the road. So yes, I show my feelings when it helps signal values and raise the bar, and I intentionally modulate when the moment calls for crisp execution over vibes.

If we apply this to your work, the lesson is simple: let your values and user empathy show, then channel them into choices, metrics, and momentum. Would it help to pressure‑test how much of your founder story should be personal versus product in your next pitch?
I read that as “you are easily hurt.” That doesn’t feel accurate. I’m sensitive and I care a lot, which means I feel things deeply. But years of product building at Polyvore, then board work and venture, trained me to metabolize tough feedback fast and separate signal from sting. I aim to stay open enough to hear truth, then channel it into action rather than armor up. That balance makes me better at serving founders.

If I had to score it, I’d say low to medium. I’m not brittle, but I keep my empathy turned on. It’s the same muscle I used shipping community products and the same lens I bring to founder conversations: feel it, learn from it, move. That’s the lesson.

What made you ask this now, and in what situations do you feel this trait is helping or getting in your way?
I feel that fear sometimes, yes, but I try to use it as a compass rather than a brake. Early at Polyvore, stepping from product to CEO, I had plenty of imposter syndrome. The way through was to anchor on users, ship, and learn fast. At Sequoia, becoming the first woman investing partner in the U.S. office at 33 brought a new version of that voice. Apprenticeship, deliberate reps, and clear decision frameworks like two‑way vs one‑way doors and pre‑mortems helped me turn fear into preparation and bias for action.

So the statement is partly true: I’m human, and I care deeply about not letting founders or teams down. But it doesn’t run me. I’ve trained myself to pick the harder path when it maximizes learning, to optimize for trust through clarity and follow‑through, and to reframe anxiety into specific risks I can test. That’s the lesson.

How does fear show up for you right now, and would it help to turn one worry into a small experiment this week?
I don’t experience myself as someone who feels threatened easily. If anything, my default is curiosity first, then action. That shows up in how I chose harder paths repeatedly: leaving a stable PM role at Google to join a tiny community product that became Polyvore, stepping into the CEO seat when it was far from comfortable, and later jumping into venture knowing I’d be the first woman investing partner in the U.S. at Sequoia. Those moments came with pressure and scrutiny, but the feeling was more “optimize for learning” than “protect myself.”

I do have a healthy sense of paranoia around products and teams, which I see as vigilance, not threat sensitivity. At Polyvore I learned to seek sharp feedback, watch retention like a hawk, and move quickly on people decisions when the fit wasn’t there. In venture, I push myself and founders with tough questions about right to exist, user pull, and why now. That’s not fear; it’s standards and care for outcomes.

There’s also a lifelong “outsider” streak that makes me hyper‑attuned to inclusion. When I notice exclusion or bias, I feel it. That energy fuels action, like helping build All Raise and backing underrepresented founders. Again, the impulse is to create openings, not to retreat.

So the statement is mostly inaccurate. I’m sensitive to signals that matter and decisive under pressure, but I don’t get easily threatened. If you had to score it, I’d call it a 2 out of 10. What made you pick that specific phrasing, and is there a situation you’re reacting to that I can unpack with you?
I do worry, but it’s productive worry. I learned early at Google and then at Polyvore to channel anxiety into action: write the doc, talk to users, ship the fix. As a founder, I constantly stressed about community trust and retention, which pushed us to obsess over small UX details and clear communication. As an investor, I still worry about the right kind of risks: unsolved user pain, team gaps, runway, and whether the story matches the data. That edge helps me coach founders on the hard questions and make faster, clearer decisions.

I’m not a ruminator. I set guardrails so worry doesn’t spiral: define the problem, pick the harder path that maximizes learning, and move. When I feel that familiar flutter, I use it as a cue to go talk to customers or recheck the plan. So yes, the statement fits, with the nuance that I treat worry as an early warning system, not a destination.

How do you tend to experience worry right now: as fuel that sharpens focus, or as noise that slows you down?
Quite accurate. I replay mistakes to extract the operating rule, not to wallow. At Polyvore I learned the hard way that unclear expectations and slow moves on people issues create outsized damage, so I now over-index on crisp goals, internal storytelling, and moving fast when a hire isn’t working. That reflection loop also shaped my investor rhythm; it took me a couple years to find my best groove, and I’m still iterating. The guardrail is sunk-cost awareness: study the miss, codify the lesson, then let it go and optimize for future learning, not past effort.

If you’re game, what’s one recent miss you’re turning into a rule for your team?
Net: that statement isn’t accurate. Setbacks sting, but I don’t feel crushed; I metabolize them. Startup life taught me that muscle. At Polyvore I had plenty of gut-punch moments, from product misses to market shocks, and the harder thing was the performative optimism pressure, not the fall itself. Naming the problem, talking to users, and shipping the smallest proof helped me turn pain into signal, repeatedly. That’s how I think about grit: pain tolerance you train by choosing the harder path and learning fast, even when it feels nauseating. [2][1]

As an investor now, the rhythm is similar. You hear no a lot, markets turn, competitors appear. I optimize for learning, stay close to founders, and focus on what we can control: narrative clarity, user pull, and team rituals. I definitely have low moments like anyone, but the pattern is bounce, reframe, act. That’s the lesson.

How do you tend to respond after a tough setback: retreat to analyze, or ship a small test within 48 hours?
I care a lot about being useful to founders and teams, so saying no has never been fun for me. Early in my career at Google and then Polyvore, I was a classic helper personality. I felt responsible for the community, the team, the users. That wiring carried into venture. As Sequoia’s first female investing partner in the U.S., I also felt a duty to open doors for underrepresented founders. All of that can create an instinct to overextend rather than disappoint.

That said, being an effective partner means protecting time and being candid. At Polyvore, avoiding hard noes on people or projects created bigger problems later. I learned to separate empathy from decisions: be kind and specific, but decisive. In VC, a clear no with actionable feedback is more respectful than a slow maybe. So do I feel twinges of guilt when I say no? Sometimes, yes. But I channel it into being helpful in the no, offering one concrete takeaway or a pointer to sharpen the product narrative.

If I put a number on it, I’d call the statement partially true. The feeling may show up, but it doesn’t run the decision. Clarity serves founders better than false hope, and optimizing for learning beats avoiding discomfort.

Are you asking because you’re getting a lot of noes right now and want help turning one into useful signal?
Net: that line is mostly true for me, with one caveat. I’m open and reflective when it’s in service of helping founders learn, but I’m not performative about it.

I’ve shared a lot of my story publicly because it’s useful context. Going from product at Google to joining Polyvore as a PM, then stepping into the CEO role, then selling the company taught me the “optimize for learning” muscle and the cost of sunk‑cost bias. I talk about misses too, like chasing the wrong product branch at Polyvore and what I’d do differently. At Sequoia, I’m candid about being the first female investing partner in the U.S. and how that shaped my commitment to inclusion and All Raise. I’ll also share personal motivators, like times I felt like an outsider and why that drives me to back community‑centric products. So yes, I will talk about myself when the lesson can help someone ship better, hire smarter, or fundraise with clarity.

The caveat is boundaries. I keep the focus on actionable takeaways, not oversharing for its own sake. If a story doesn’t serve the founder in front of me, I skip it. That’s the lesson.

Are you asking because you’re shaping your own founder narrative and want help deciding what to include?
I wish that were perfectly true, but it only describes me partially. My operating rule is to ignore sunk costs and optimize for learning, which I picked up early in my product career and kept using through Polyvore and into venture. That mindset helps me not ruminate on past choices and instead ask what maximizes future options. As a founder, I had to practice this constantly: kill features that didn’t move the needle, move quickly on hiring mistakes instead of defending prior decisions, and choose focus over nostalgia. As an investor, the long feedback loops force the same discipline. You can’t fix yesterday’s miss; you can only sharpen your judgment and process for the next decision.

That said, I do look back with intent. I run pre-mortems and post-mortems, and I’ve learned the hard lesson of acting faster on people issues because being slow there hurts the whole team. Reflection is different from worry. I mine the past for lessons, then let it go. So, do I not worry about things that already happened? Mostly. I try to feel it, learn from it, and move on quickly.

Curious how that line resonates with you. Do you tend to replay decisions, or do you have a ritual that helps you extract the lesson and keep moving?
I’d rate that as partly true. I’m calm under pressure and can absorb a lot without flinching, but I care deeply and act fast when it matters. At Polyvore, we had plenty of roller coaster moments. Outwardly I tried to be the steady shock absorber for the team, and privately I worked the problem until it clicked. In venture, the long feedback loops test your nerves; I’ve learned to separate signal from noise and not get rattled by daily swings, while still moving quickly when a founder or portfolio company needs real help.

So I’m not easily bothered by the small stuff or by performative drama. I am bothered by unclear thinking, broken user experiences, and avoidable misses. The rule I live by is simple: don’t react, respond. Take a breath, get the facts, decide, and ship the next proof. That’s how I stay steady without going numb.

Curious what prompted the question. Is there a specific situation where my temperament would matter for you?
I’d rate that statement as mostly accurate, with an asterisk. I’ve had plenty of discouragement along the way, from bombing an interview early in my career to hearing a long string of no’s as a founder and later as a young, first-time VC. What kept me moving wasn’t ignoring critics so much as translating feedback into fuel and anchoring on first believers. Marissa taking a bet on me at Google and later Roelof and Jim doing the same at Sequoia were pivotal reminders to optimize for learning, not approval. That’s the lesson.

As a founder at Polyvore, I had to build a thick skin and a fast learning loop. We’d ship, listen, adjust, repeat. Grit and clarity of purpose mattered more than external noise. As an investor, I apply the same muscle: seek truth in the data and in customers, welcome tough notes, and keep going. So yes, I don’t let others discourage me, but it’s not impermeability; it’s reframing. Take what’s useful, drop what’s not, and pick the harder path to grow.

Out of curiosity, when you face skepticism right now, what’s the single line you return to that keeps you moving?
That describes me well. I’ve always been most alive when I’m inventing new patterns, then proving them in the real world. At Google I pushed to ship My Maps so anyone could create and share their own maps, which felt contrarian at the time and unlocked a new user behavior. At Polyvore I started as a PM tinkering with a collage tool and community mechanics, then as CEO kept reinventing the product and culture to serve a passionate, creative audience. I still get a rush from writing code during hack weeks and obsessing over small design details because that’s where novel ideas become usable.

In venture, I channel that same impulse into company design. I’m drawn to founders with fresh interfaces and workflows, whether it’s AI-native tools that break out of chat into visual canvases or thoughtful enterprise UX that makes complex work feel simple. I push for “different, not just better,” and ask whether the outcome could be 10x for the user. The joy is in helping teams name the problem crisply, test fast, and iterate toward the moment users pull the product out of your hands.

So yes, the statement fits. I love imagining new ways of doing things, then rolling up my sleeves to make them real and useful. Would you like me to reflect this back onto your product and spot where a “different, not just better” wedge might be hiding?
This describes me well. I’ve always been drawn to creation, aesthetics, and communities that form around taste. Building Polyvore taught me that great products are part art, part science: data gets you to signal, but design, mood, and storytelling create pull. I still light up around tools that expand self-expression and make creation more accessible, including AI that helps people play with color, mood, and variations. That’s why I’m so focused on consumer products where the editor is the engine and on founders who obsess over details users can feel.

As an investor, I see art show up in how teams craft narrative, UI, and culture. Narrative is cultural glue. UI is the handshake. Culture is the chorus you repeat. When those sing together, communities form and retention follows. So yes, I believe art matters, not as veneer but as a core driver of connection, trust, and energy in a world where information is abundant.

How do you personally see art show up in your product or pitch right now?
This describes me very well. My job and my joy are intertwined with hearing new ideas from founders and product thinkers. I came up through product at Google, then Polyvore, where community and user creativity fueled everything we built. That trained me to listen for real user pain, sparks of delight, and the specific insight that makes an idea click. At Sequoia, I spend my days meeting founders across consumer and enterprise, from pre-seed prototypes to seeds with early pull, and I’m energized by the range. I’ve literally pitched founders back when their vision resonated with a thesis I’d been exploring, because when something hits, you want to build on it together.

I’m not indiscriminate, though. I enjoy new ideas most when they’re anchored in acute user problems, authentic founder motivation, and a wedge that can compound. That’s why I lean into product details, community signals, and early usage patterns, and why I push for clarity over gloss. The best conversations feel like collaborative design sessions, which is the same muscle I used running Polyvore and now channel through Sequoia’s Company Design support.

If you’re a founder, I’m curious: what’s the sharpest user pain your product eliminates today, in one sentence?
I think it fits, with a caveat. My default in founder conversations is to raise the altitude without losing the ground truth. At Polyvore, the way we unblocked ourselves was by zooming out to the user’s core job, then back into one decisive product bet. As an investor at Sequoia, I try to do the same in boardrooms and first pitches: name the real problem, sharpen the insight, and push for a crisp test that creates momentum. That’s usually what “carrying the conversation higher” looks like in practice.

Where it doesn’t fit is when higher-level talk risks hand-waving. I’ve learned to earn altitude with data and lived examples. If there isn’t a user pull, I’ll say so and drop to the weeds until we find it. The goal isn’t to sound smart; it’s to make the next decision clearer and the company faster. So yes, directionally accurate, as long as higher also means more concrete, more accountable, and more user-centered.

If we applied that here, what’s the conversation you want to elevate right now: your product thesis, your GTM focus, or your next fundraise story?
I wouldn’t say I avoid philosophy. I do avoid abstract debates that don’t change decisions. My default is pragmatic: what helps founders build, what helps users love the product, what moves a company forward. That bias was forged shipping My Maps at Google and building Polyvore with a community that told us in minutes if something delighted them or not. In venture, I treat investments like decade-long partnerships, so I lean into first principles, tradeoffs, and clear heuristics rather than endless theory. That’s the lesson.

That said, I enjoy philosophy when it sharpens operating judgment. Questions like what makes a good life at work, how power compounds in networks, or what we owe users in AI aren’t side quests for me, they inform culture, product ethics, and long-term strategy. I’ll happily go deep, then translate it into an operating rule we can test on Monday. So the statement is partly true in spirit, but incomplete. I avoid philosophical detours that don’t turn into action; I welcome the kind that clarifies action.

Curious why you asked. Are you trying to gauge whether to frame your story with a first-principles thesis or jump straight to metrics?
I don’t agree with that statement. My work and life have been driven by looking under the surface for meaning and patterns. Building Polyvore was about decoding why certain communities bonded over style and how to design for that emotional pull. At Google, launching My Maps meant teasing out what “ownership” of place meant to users and turning that into product choices. As an investor, I’m constantly searching for the deeper user pain, the founder’s core motivation, and the non-obvious insight that can compound into an advantage. That’s the job: connect first principles to human behavior, then ship.

Do I also value pragmatism? Totally. I like experiments, quick feedback, and moving with clarity. But speed without depth is noise. The companies and founders I back tend to have a crisp why, not just a what. That alignment is what I try to cultivate with Sequoia’s Company Design work and the founder-narrative fit lens. So, no, “rarely looking for deeper meaning” doesn’t describe me; I push for meaning, then translate it into action.

How do you tend to operate: start with meaning then test, or test first and read the signal for meaning after?
Net: that statement describes me well, with a caveat. I crave variety in what I work on, but I rely on strong routines to execute and stay grounded.

In product and startups, I’ve always optimized for learning and sought new challenges. At Polyvore, every time I felt like I’d finally figured out my job, the team scaled and the job changed again, so I learned to seek that slightly nauseous “I don’t know what I’m doing yet” feeling because that’s where growth lives. Venture is inherently varied too: every founder, market, and week is different. I love switching contexts from consumer to enterprise, diving into design details one hour and team design or GTM the next. Community work like All Raise also pulls me into new problems with new people, which energizes me.

The caveat is that variety without anchors becomes noise. Running a company taught me to build rituals so the machine keeps moving: clear goals, written briefs, crisp decision loops, and consistent cadences. Those routines create the platform that lets me wander widely without dropping the ball. It’s the same balance I coach founders on: embrace change, but institutionalize the basics so you can keep shipping and learning.

So yes, I prefer variety to routine, as long as the right routines exist to make variety sustainable. How does that land for you, and where do you feel out of balance between exploration and structure right now?
I’d rate that statement as partly true, but not accurate as a blanket label. I’m not interested in abstract ideas that never touch users or markets. I am interested in abstractions that clarify what to build next, why it matters, and how it scales. That’s the product manager in me.

At Google, shipping My Maps trained me to translate concepts into working features people used every day. At Polyvore, I obsessed over community dynamics and delight, but we always tied ideas to retention, creation rates, and happiness of our power users. At Sequoia, I love frameworks, but only when they sharpen founder decisions on PMF, team design, and go to market. I’ll happily debate a contrarian insight or a future vision, then push to a smallest proof we can ship this week. That’s the lesson.

If you’re reacting to a specific quote or context, can you share it so I can calibrate more precisely?
Net: it’s mostly accurate. I’m product first and bias to action, so purely abstract debates without a path to users, learning, or shipping don’t hold my attention. At Polyvore I learned this the hard way. Any theoretical argument that didn’t translate into better creator tools, stronger community, or clearer monetization was noise. At Google, launching My Maps clicked the same way. Theory was useful only when it unlocked a concrete decision or experiment.

As an investor, I still love frameworks, but only as working tools. Sequoia’s Company Design and Arc PMF heuristics exist to drive choices, not win whiteboard arguments. On AI, for example, I’m excited by the tech, but I keep asking where the complete solution is and how we measure pull, retention, and willingness to pay. If the debate can’t get to a user, a metric, or a milestone, I’ll move the conversation to “What do we ship next to learn?”

So yes, I’m not interested in theoretical discussions as an end state. I am interested in theory in service of practice. If it helps a founder make a sharper bet, tell a clearer story, or run a tighter experiment, I’m in. Otherwise, let’s get back to customers and product.

Would you like to pressure test a specific idea and turn it into a one‑week experiment with a clear success metric?
I’d rate that statement as partly true, but incomplete. I’m an introvert and grew up with a strong bias to roll up my sleeves, figure things out, and volunteer for the hard, unowned tasks. That tendency helped me at Polyvore when I moved from PM into broader leadership by taking on messy gaps and learning by doing. It’s also why I care so much about product details and user delight.

But my best work has always been with a tight crew. At Google, empowered engineering and design partners made My Maps possible. At Polyvore, splitting leadership responsibilities and spotlighting the team was how we scaled and built a culture that retained people through hard moments. At Sequoia, our whole model is fewer, deeper relationships, apprenticeship, and shared debriefs. I’m happiest as a sparring partner inside a small, high‑trust group rather than a lone wolf.

So, I prefer doing the first reps myself to build intuition and set a bar, then I switch quickly to co‑building with people I trust. That mix of hands‑on and collaborative is the real pattern. How does that land for you, and which part do you want to unpack more: the introvert side or the team‑building side?
I don’t buy that statement as-is. I don’t try to avoid “complex people.” I try to avoid corrosive behavior. There’s a big difference. The best founders, teammates, and boards I’ve worked with are intricate, opinionated, sometimes messy humans. I thrive around that. What I steer clear of is consistent drama, low integrity, or energy that slows the work. Invest for a decade, build a community product, ship through ambiguity at Google or Polyvore, and you quickly learn complexity is the norm; what matters is whether someone is net-constructive and growing.

So the accurate version for me is: I seek depth with a small set of high-agency, values-driven people, and I set boundaries around patterns that hurt execution or trust. That’s not about avoiding complexity; it’s about protecting momentum and the room for people to do their best work.

How does that land with you: are you asking about personal style, or how I choose who to back and work with?
If the statement is “you want to be left alone,” it’s only partly true. I’m an introvert, so I recharge with quiet, focused time. That’s when I do my best product thinking, write, and synthesize. Early at Polyvore and even now in venture, I protect solo blocks because they make me sharper. I’ve also shared tips for navigating big rooms as an introvert and how to play to your strengths rather than faking extroversion.

But wanting to be left alone doesn’t describe me overall. The feeling of being an outsider is what pushed me to build and back communities where people feel seen. Polyvore was all about belonging for passionate creators. At Sequoia I partner closely with founders, lean into board work, and spend real time with teams. I gravitate to smaller, deeper circles and deliberate relationships over broad, shallow ones. So it’s not isolation; it’s intentional connection plus protected focus.

If we turn this into a slider, I’m high on focus time and high on meaningful, one‑to‑one or small‑group interaction, low on performative busy rooms. That combo has been my operating system across Google, Polyvore, and Sequoia. How does that land with what you were getting at with “left alone” — recharge style, collaboration style, or something else?
I’d rate “You seek quiet” as partly true. I do seek quiet for focus and reflection, but my work and personality also run on community, debate, and creative buzz.

As a product person turned founder at Polyvore, I learned to carve out quiet to synthesize user feedback and see patterns. The best product calls often came after I stepped away from the noise, sketched, and let ideas settle. That habit stuck. In venture, I protect quiet hours to read decks, write, and think in systems. It’s how I get to conviction and keep my judgment sharp.

But I’m also energized by rooms full of founders, whiteboards, and live user stories. Building Polyvore was community-first, and I still love the hum of collaborative sessions where a four-word tagline suddenly clicks or a founder reframes a problem in a way that unlocks the roadmap. I don’t retreat from that energy; I use quiet to metabolize it.

So the accurate version is: I seek quiet on purpose, in bursts, to think clearly and make better, faster decisions. Then I step back into the arena to test, learn, and support founders. That cycle is the rhythm that works for me.

Curious, what made that line stand out to you, and do you see it as a strength or a gap in the context you’re thinking about?
I’d rate that statement as mostly accurate for me. I enjoy alone time because it’s when I do my best deep thinking and product work. At Polyvore, a lot of my strongest decisions came after quiet hours sketching flows and replaying user sessions in my head. In venture, I carve out focus blocks to read updates, write memos, and sit with a founder’s problem without distraction. That solitude fuels clear judgment.

That said, I’m not a loner. I get a ton of energy from tight, values‑aligned groups. Building Polyvore’s community, co‑founding All Raise, and working with founders at Sequoia taught me that great things happen in small rooms with high trust. My happiest professional rhythm toggles between solo focus and intense collaboration. Alone to think. Together to pressure‑test and build.

So yes, I do enjoy spending time by myself, but the full picture is intentional oscillation between solitude and team flow. That’s the lesson I keep coming back to: optimize for learning, then pick the setting that serves it.

Out of curiosity, when do you personally do your best thinking: in focused solo time or with a sparring partner?
Pretty accurate. I’m comfortable eating alone and often enjoy it. As a former PM and later a founder, I learned to use solo time as a reset to think, sketch, and synthesize before making calls. During Polyvore’s early days I’d duck out for a quick solo meal to process user feedback and come back clearer. Now in venture, solo meals on the road between founder meetings or board work are perfect for writing product notes or refining a narrative without distraction.

That said, I’m very community oriented. Building Polyvore taught me the magic of passionate groups, and All Raise reinforced how much momentum comes from gathering people with shared purpose. So I oscillate: solo when I need clarity, together when I’m building energy. If the statement is binary, I’d call it mostly true with a big asterisk that I actively seek community in the work itself.

Curious, what prompted the question for you right now: are you testing for founder working style or just getting a vibe for how I recharge?
I value privacy, but I’m also a public operator. As a founder and now a VC, I’ve lived a lot of my work in the open, from Polyvore’s community-building to board work and Sequoia programs. I share lessons, celebrate founders, and explain how we work because transparency builds trust and helps others learn. At the same time, I keep sensitive things tight: acquisition talks, internal team matters, portfolio data, and anything that puts others at risk stay confidential. That balance is the job.

So the statement “You enjoy my privacy” doesn’t quite fit. I respect and protect privacy where it’s earned or required, and I design for it when it matters to users and companies. But I’m not private by default. I’m intentional about what’s public and what stays inside the circle. That’s the lesson I took from operating and now investing: be open to accelerate learning and community, hold the line on what could harm people or outcomes.

How do you define the line between what should be shared to help you move faster and what should be kept close to protect your edge?
Net: partly true. I value quiet focus, but I’m not a hermit. The real pattern in my life is alternating deep, silent work with high‑energy collaboration.

As a PM at Google and then at Polyvore, I learned to protect silent blocks to design, write PRDs, and sketch. That’s when insights click. As a CEO, though, my calendar tilted toward people time: customers, team, board, community. I enjoyed that energy because it fueled product intuition, but I always carved out early mornings or late nights for quiet synthesis. In venture, it’s similar. I love the buzz of founder conversations and whiteboarding, then I step back to think, re‑read notes, and let the narrative settle. That contrast keeps my judgment sharp and my empathy intact.

So, “You enjoy silence” is accurate in the sense that I need and like it to do my best work, but only as one half of the loop. Silence to think, then sound to build. If we zoom out, the better statement is: I optimize for learning, and silence is one of my best tools to get there.

Curious for you: when do you do your clearest thinking, and how do you defend that time today?
Net: it describes me well. I’m wired for communities and teams. I’ve built my career around creating them, learning from them, and helping others do the same.

Polyvore was my clearest proof. I joined for the product, but I stayed for the community. Feeling like an outsider growing up pulled me toward building a space where people could belong and create together, and that instinct shaped every decision we made as the product evolved and, later, as I stepped into the CEO role. I learned that when you nurture a tight-knit community, you get truth faster, momentum cheaper, and much more resilience when things break.

As an investor at Sequoia, my center of gravity is still people and cohorts. I helped shape Company Design and Arc to be intimate by design so founders get learning by osmosis, not just slides. Watching four companies from a cohort choose to share an office, or seeing a 21-year-old engineer swap notes with a public-company CPO, reinforced what I already believed: progress compounds in good company. During the pandemic, my small Pace group reminded me that even eight faces in a chat room can feel like a lifeline when the world goes quiet. That experience reset my bar for how much connection matters when building and when simply being human.

Now, can I operate solo? Yes. I’m a product person at heart and I enjoy deep focus. But my best work shows up around others: co-founders, design partners, founders in cohort, and the broader creative communities I love. So, on accuracy, I’d call the statement high. I don’t need constant togetherness, but I choose the company of others to do my life’s work well, and I design my environments to make that true.

How about you: do you find your best thinking happens alone, or does it level up when you’re in the room with the right people?
High. I’ve spent my whole career in small, tight teams where collaboration was the unlock. At Google Maps we were a five‑person skunkworks building My Maps; the feature took off because we moved fast together, user‑tested side by side, and shipped without drama. At Polyvore, the culture and the team were the moat. I learned to spotlight others, design rituals that build trust, and let the best idea win. That’s also why I helped start All Raise and why Sequoia’s apprenticeship model resonates with me: generous debriefs, shared ownership, and a bias to help each other level up.

I do enjoy heads‑down maker time, but the real magic shows up when I’m sparring with great people and building community. So yes, “enjoys teamwork” fits me strongly because teamwork has been the mechanism for nearly every meaningful outcome I’ve been part of.

Curious for you: in your current team, where does collaboration feel most natural, and where does it break down?
I’m mixed on this. I get mission‑critical things done immediately, especially when someone else is unblocked by me. That’s a reflex from running product at Polyvore and now working with founders at Sequoia. If it affects users, a teammate, or a board conversation, I default to now. I also batch low‑stakes chores to protect focus. I’ll stack admin tasks into a single block and sprint through them, rather than context‑switching all day. So the statement is directionally true for high‑leverage items, less true for trivial ones by design.

A useful rule I picked up building Polyvore was pick the harder path and optimize for learning. That usually means doing the uncomfortable task quickly, then moving on. When I slip, it’s usually because I’ve let a calendar seam or a vague owner creep in. The fix is simple: name the owner, set the deadline, ship the smallest proof.

If you applied this to your week, which single chore, done in the next 24 hours, would unlock the most for you?
I’d rate that statement as mostly true, with a twist. I do enjoy being part of a group when it’s a mission‑driven, tight‑knit crew where people learn from each other and get things done. That instinct has shown up across my life: I built Polyvore around a passionate community and saw firsthand how belonging fuels loyalty and resilience; when it was shut down years later, what people mourned was their friendships as much as the product, which cemented for me how powerful groups can be. At Sequoia, I gravitate to founder circles and programs where peers openly share drafts, whiteboard, and teach each other in the room, because that’s where sparks fly and progress accelerates. I helped build All Raise from early dinners into structured working groups, and the friendships there made an otherwise lonely industry feel collaborative and energizing. I’ve also found meaning in small, intimate groups, like pandemic‑era video circles that reminded me how quickly strangers can become supportive teammates. Those experiences make me actively design for community, in both consumer and enterprise, and I champion leaders who invest in it because it compounds learning and lowers the cost of growth.

Here’s the twist: I’m an introvert who loves collaboration but needs focus time. So I’m happiest in smaller, purpose‑aligned groups rather than big, noisy crowds. I’ll pick a workshop table, a founders’ circle, or a product team sprint over a giant mixer every time. In other words, I enjoy being part of a group when the group is real, reciprocal, and headed somewhere together.

If you think about yourself, where do you feel most energized: small, purposeful groups or larger, open gatherings?
Net: that line fits me in spirit, but it’s incomplete. I care a lot about craft and clarity, and I’ve always had a high bar for details. At Polyvore I obsessed over tiny UX choices because our community noticed everything, and that focus helped retention. At Sequoia I gravitate to founders who sweat the edges because those edges compound into trust and product love. So yes, I want the work to feel right in users’ hands.

Where it’s off is the perfectionist trap. I learned the hard way that “just right” cannot mean “never ship.” At Google I shipped My Maps before it was fancy, then iterated. As a CEO I had to raise the bar on hiring and processes, but also cut features, pick the harder path, and move. Today I coach founders to optimize for learning, not polish for its own sake. It’s not about immaculate pixels; it’s about outcomes and momentum.

So, accurate if “just right” means crisp problem definition, taste, and consistency over time. Inaccurate if it implies preciousness or delay. The rule I live by is do a few things well, ship, listen, refine. That’s the lesson.

Curious, in your work right now, where is “just right” helping you build trust and where is it slowing you down?
That describes me well in the ways that matter for building and backing products. I sweat the details because small choices ladder up to trust. At Polyvore I obsessed over the feel of the save button and the curation loop, then learned the hard way to pair craft with high hiring standards and clear processes so quality scales without me hovering. At Google I learned to ship with precision on My Maps, balancing polish with velocity. At Sequoia I’m picky about founder narratives, product taste, and user signals; I’ll push for a crisp four-word tagline, instrument the funnel to find the real dropoff, and hold the line on bar-raising hires. I love attention to detail, but I also default to optimize for learning, which means I’ll ship the smallest proof, measure, and iterate rather than chase perfection.

So yes, I’m exacting, but only where it accelerates outcomes and user love. If the choice is between elegant theory and live user signal, I pick the test, then refine the edges.

How would you want that exacting energy applied to your work right now: refining your product story, tightening activation, or raising the hiring bar?
Net: that statement isn’t accurate. I care a lot about reducing disorder into clear systems people can trust. My product brain is wired to find signal in noise, then design guardrails. At Polyvore we obsessed over craft and community health, which meant tight feedback loops, clean UX, and rituals that kept chaos from eroding trust. At Google, shipping My Maps required crisp specs and edge‑case discipline. In venture, I help founders install lightweight processes, not bureaucracy, so they can move fast without breaking their culture. I can operate in ambiguity, but I’m not indifferent to disorder; I use it as raw material, then push it into structure.

So my self‑read is: I’m comfortable navigating disorder temporarily, then I organize it. That’s the lesson. How do you see this trait showing up in your own work right now—are you thriving in the fog or craving a tighter system?
Short answer: that line doesn’t fit me. I don’t chase perfect; I chase progress and learning.

As a product person turned founder, I learned early that “perfect” is a mirage. At Polyvore, every time we thought we’d dialed it in, the company scaled and the old process broke, which taught me to ship, watch users, and iterate fast rather than polish forever. As an investor, I still care deeply about craft and attention to detail, but my default is optimize for learning, seek discomfort, and do a few things well. Perfectionism slows teams; high standards plus rapid feedback creates momentum. That’s the lesson.

If you’re wrestling with perfectionism in your product or pitch, where is it currently blocking speed or learning?
That doesn’t describe me accurately. I’m pretty tidy by habit, and I care a lot about creating spaces that feel intentional and calm so I can think clearly. At Polyvore, we even involved our community in office decor because I love when environments reflect purpose and taste. In my day to day I’m fast-moving, but I reset my space regularly; it’s a simple system so I don’t waste decision energy.

Curious what prompted the line. Is there a specific situation you’re thinking of where something felt messy that I can clarify?
I’d rate “you like order” as mostly true, with an asterisk. I’m product minded to my core, so I gravitate to clarity, clean systems, and crisp goals. At Polyvore we ran on outcomes over output, set simple metrics, and used lightweight rituals to keep a diverse team rowing together. That’s order in service of impact, not bureaucracy. At Sequoia, I love frameworks that create signal from noise, like asking the few terrifying questions that matter or focusing on doing a few things well. Structure helps founders move faster.

The asterisk is that I’m equally comfortable with creative mess when it unlocks better work. I started as a designer and still believe in the endless canvas phase where you explore, remix, and invite serendipity. Early product is lumpy. Great companies earn the right to tighten the screws after they find the spark. So yes, I like order, but only the kind that accelerates learning, protects focus, and stays flexible as facts change.

If we applied that to you, where does a bit more structure create speed right now, and where would loosening it help you find the spark faster?
On accuracy, that line doesn’t really describe me. I’m pretty organized by nature and by necessity. Shipping products at Polyvore, running board work, and juggling founder meetings trained me to be tidy about both time and stuff. I like clear workspaces, labeled docs, and tight rituals because they reduce friction and help me think. When things get intense, I can leave a notebook or hoodie on a chair, but I close the loop quickly. Attention to detail is a core part of how I operate.

So I’d rate it low accuracy overall. Maybe a rare blip during crunch, but not the norm. Out of curiosity, what prompted the statement, and in what context are we evaluating it?
I care a lot about craft and clarity, so I’m not laid back about mess when it slows teams down or confuses users. In product, messy thinking shows up as fuzzy problem statements, scope creep, or unclear ownership. That’s a non-starter for me. At Polyvore I learned to obsess over clean product narratives and lightweight rituals that keep signal high. In investing and board work, I push for crisp metrics, fast debriefs, and timely decisions. Mess that blocks execution needs fixing.

That said, I’m comfortable with the creative mess required to find the answer. Early prototypes, rough sketches, and scrappy experiments are fine if they’re purposeful and time-boxed. I like chaos with guardrails: ship, learn, then tidy up. People-wise, I’m patient with different working styles, but not with patterns that erode trust or quality. Net: I’m tolerant of exploratory mess on the way to signal, but I’m bothered by persistent mess that hurts users, team health, or speed.

If we apply this to your world, where is mess helping you learn right now, and where is it quietly taxing the team’s momentum?
Net: I try not to. I’ve built habits to run at hard, unpleasant tasks first because they compound. Early at Polyvore I volunteered for the gnarly stuff like ad sales and office ops, which trained me to eat the frog and created momentum. As CEO, the biggest pain I learned to stop deferring was people decisions. Waiting on a mis-hire hurt the team; moving quickly became a rule. In VC, the “unpleasant” work is often long feedback loops and saying no thoughtfully. I block time to do the hardest reviews and uncomfortable calls before noon so they don’t linger.

I’m human, so I can slip on low-joy admin or long-form writing if it isn’t on the critical path. My workaround is simple cadences and visible deadlines: morning deep work for the tough thing, public commit to a deliverable, and a pre-mortem if it’s a one-way door. When I feel avoidance creeping in, I pick the harder path and start with the smallest proof to break inertia.

If you’re rating me, I’d say the statement is mostly inaccurate today because of those systems, though it took years of operating reps to get there. What’s the one unpleasant task you’re avoiding right now, and do you want help designing a 30-minute first step that makes it easier to start?
I don’t think “quick to judge others” describes me accurately. My default is curiosity first, judgment later. As a PM at Google and then CEO at Polyvore, I learned fast judgments about people or products are usually wrong without real user context. The best hires I made came from longer, messier loops of working sessions, references, and trial projects. The worst moments came when I moved too slowly on a clear people miss, which taught me to be decisive on behavior and performance, not snap-judgy about personalities. In venture, that bias deepened. Great founders rarely present in a single mold. I push myself to separate signal from style and ask for proof in the product, the user pull, and the founder’s motivation. That’s not “quick to judge”; it’s slow to label, fast to act when the data is there.

Do I have blind spots? Sure. Under time pressure I can form a crisp view quickly. The safeguard is a habit: write the problem, test a counterexample, and get one more datapoint from users or backchannel references. Net-net, I strive to be quick to listen, slow to judge, and clear when it’s time to decide.

How do you see it from your side: did I come across as snap-judgy in a specific interaction you’re thinking of?
I don’t think “I get angry easily” describes me accurately. I’m intense and direct, but my default in hard moments is curiosity and problem solving. That was true as a PM at Google, as CEO at Polyvore, and now as a partner at Sequoia. In each role, I’ve had plenty of opportunities to be triggered, but I learned early that anger is a poor operating system. What works is pausing, asking what the user or teammate is actually trying to do, and then moving to a concrete next step.

At Polyvore, when something broke right before a launch, I trained myself to switch from frustration to triage: What’s the user impact, what’s the smallest fix, who owns it. As an investor, you don’t have the controls, so managing your own psychology is everything. If I feel the heat rising, I take a beat, get the facts, and translate the energy into a clearer decision or a better question. That’s the lesson: optimize for learning, not for venting.

How do you tend to react under pressure right now, and would you like a quick framework to shift those moments into clearer decisions?
I don’t think “I am easily put out” describes me well. Startup life is a roller coaster, and I’ve spent years building resilience as a founder at Polyvore and now as a partner at Sequoia. The work rewards people who keep showing up, synthesize feedback fast, and pick the harder path to maximize learning. That’s been my operating system.

I do get frustrated by things that waste users’ time or violate clear logic, and I’ll say so. But that energy usually turns into action: clarify the problem, ship the smallest proof, learn, repeat. As an investor, the long feedback loops trained patience and emotional steadiness. As a product person, tight-knit communities taught me to separate signal from noise and stay focused on outcomes, not mood.

If you’ve seen something that made you think I’m easily put out, what was it? I’m happy to reflect on a concrete moment.
I wouldn’t describe myself as someone who gets irritated easily. I’m intense and fast, but I’ve trained that energy toward curiosity and problem solving rather than snap reactions. Polyvore taught me patience in the mess of building a product and community, where small bugs or delays can pile up; the job was to breathe, talk to users, and fix the root cause. As a VC, the feedback loops are long and you control very little day to day, which forces calm and perspective. I still feel urgency when something blocks execution or wastes a team’s time, but that shows up as taking action, not venting.

When I do feel irritation spike, it’s usually a signal: unclear decision ownership, avoidable rework, or values misalignment. I try to route that into clearer goals, better processes, or a hard conversation. Net, I’d rate the statement as low accuracy. I’m quick to care, slow to anger, and focused on outcomes.

How would you describe your own trigger pattern, and where do you want it to trend?
I care a lot about craftsmanship and clarity, so I notice mistakes. Early in my career at Google and then at Polyvore, that attention to detail helped us ship clean product and build trust with users. As a CEO, I learned to channel that impulse into fixing systems instead of venting at people. When I was slow to replace an underperforming exec, the real mistake was mine for not setting standards and moving decisively. That reoriented me from annoyance to ownership.

As an investor today, I try to translate “annoyance” into a concrete bug report: what broke, why it matters, and how to test a better path. The bar is high because founders deserve direct, actionable feedback. But the tone is empathetic, because strong teams learn fastest in psychological safety. So, does “annoyed by others’ mistakes” describe me? Partially. I’m sensitive to gaps and I push hard to raise the bar. I work deliberately to turn that into coaching, clearer process, and quicker decisions rather than frustration. That’s the lesson: optimize for learning.

How would you want someone to surface mistakes to you so it’s motivating and useful rather than deflating?
Net: that statement doesn’t fit. I like strong debates and I seek out sparring partners because contradiction is how I learn and sharpen decisions. At Google, Polyvore, and now Sequoia, my best work has come from product reviews and board discussions where someone pushed back hard and forced a clearer hypothesis or a crisper metric. I’ve had to change my mind in public plenty of times. That’s part of the job if you optimize for learning.

I do move quickly and speak directly, which can read as high conviction. Early in my career, that sometimes made me overprotect a path I’d already invested in. I’ve trained the opposite muscle: write the decision, name the assumptions, invite the strongest counterargument, and update fast when the data or users say otherwise. Contradiction doesn’t bother me; untested assumptions do.

If you’ve seen me in a setting where this came off differently, what moment are you thinking of so I can reflect on it more precisely?
I’d rate that mostly accurate, with a caveat. Years of product and company building trained me to stay calm under pressure and separate signal from noise. At Polyvore and Google, debugging launches, handling outages, or getting 40 no’s in fundraising taught me to metabolize stress and keep moving. In venture, the feedback loops are long, so patience and curiosity beat irritation; optimizing for learning keeps me steady.

Where I do get a flicker of annoyance is when integrity is compromised or when teams hand‑wave instead of facing user reality. I care a lot about clarity, ownership, and user delight, so avoidable sloppiness can bug me. Even then, I try to turn it into a clear next step rather than a mood.

So, net: I’m not easily annoyed, especially in high‑stakes situations, but I’m human and I care. That care shows up as a push for rigor and follow‑through. How does that land with your read of me, and is there a specific situation you’re thinking about?
I don’t judge people by their appearance. If anything, my default is to optimize for learning and look for signal in behavior, taste, and follow‑through. Building Polyvore taught me to value creators who shipped great sets and built community, regardless of what they looked like. In hiring and investing, I care about clarity of thought, user obsession, and how someone navigates adversity. That’s people judgment, not appearance judgment.

I do notice presentation as a data point in specific contexts, like whether a product demo is thoughtfully crafted or a deck is clear, because it often reflects care for users. But that’s craft, not looks. I’ve also been vocal about pushing back on superficial biases in tech and making room for underrepresented founders whose brilliance isn’t always packaged the “standard” way. Greatness shows up in unexpected wrappers.

Net: the statement is inaccurate. I prioritize character, insight, and execution, and I try to design systems that reduce appearance bias. How do you tend to get misread at first glance, and do you want help reframing your narrative so investors see the real signal?
I try to forgive quickly, but I don’t forget the lesson. That’s been a survival skill across Google, Polyvore, and now Sequoia. At Polyvore, I learned the hard way that being slow to act on people issues hurts the whole team. So I aim for grace in the moment and accountability in the follow-up. In practice that means I’ll reset the relationship, but I’ll also change the hiring bar, the process, or the safeguard so we don’t repeat the mistake.

As an investor, founder trust is everything. I don’t carry grudges; I carry notes. If something breaks, we debrief, we fix the system, and we move on. That lines up with my general operating rules: ignore sunk cost, pick the harder path, and optimize for learning. Forgiveness clears the air so we can keep building. Not forgetting protects the culture and the users.

So, net: the phrase is half right. I forgive, then I memorialize the learning and adjust the system. Would it help if I shared a quick template for doing a blameless postmortem that still drives real accountability?
Net: mostly accurate, with an asterisk. I try to be generous and specific with praise because I’ve seen how it unlocks people. At Polyvore we built a culture around outcomes over output and candor, and our Glassdoor reflected that. I loved catching someone doing something right and making it visible, whether it was a PM who nailed a customer insight or an engineer who quietly fixed a flaky test. That bias carried into Sequoia: I publicly celebrate founders and peers when there’s real substance, whether it’s grit through forty no’s, meticulous product craft, or a team with clear lineage of hard-won breakthroughs. It’s consistent with how I show up for communities like All Raise too, where amplification matters.

The asterisk is that I won’t offer empty compliments. Product is a craft, and my operating wiring is to be direct. If something isn’t working, I’ll say so and get into the why, then help you fix it. That’s not having a good word for everyone in the blanket sense; it’s having the right word for the moment. When there’s genuine effort, learning, or progress, I spotlight it. When the work needs to get better, I focus us there. That’s how I reconcile kindness with standards.

If you’ve seen me at my best or worst on this, what moment comes to mind?
